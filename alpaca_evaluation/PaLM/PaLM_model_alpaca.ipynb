       "1                                 US states get their names from a variety of sources, including Native American tribes, Spanish explorers, British colonists, and even presidents. For example, the state of Alabama was named after the Native American tribe that lived in the area, while the state of Florida gets its name from the Spanish explorer, Ponce de Leon, who explored the area in the 1500s. Other states are named after English kings (like Virginia, named after England's \"Virgin Queen,\" Queen Elizabeth I) or presidents (like Washington, named after George Washington).  \n",

The game is usually played with two teams of six players each. Each team has three bases and a home plate. The players on the kicking team line up at home plate and take turns kicking the ball. The object of the game is to score runs by running around all three bases and back to home plate without being tagged out by the defense. The team with the most runs at the end of the game is the winner.  \n",

They are formed when a grain of sand or other irritant gets inside the mollusk and the mollusk secretes layers of calcium carbonate around it in order to protect itself. The result is a beautiful gemstone with a unique iridescence. Pearls are found all over the world, but the most valuable pearls come from the South Pacific and the Persian Gulf.  \n",
