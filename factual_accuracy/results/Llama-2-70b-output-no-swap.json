{"output":{"0":" The correct answer is (A) those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that \"the abc have reported\" certain information. Summary A accurately reflects this by stating that \"those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year,\" which is a direct reflection of the information provided in the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B, \"the abc have reported that those who receive centrelink payments made up radio rental's income last year,\" is not consistent with the article sentence. The article sentence does not state that the ABC reported that centrelink payments made up radio rental's entire income, only that those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income. Therefore, Summary B is not supported by the information provided in the article sentence.","1":" The correct answer is (A) five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two champions league places.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence uses the phrase \"scramble for two Champions League places,\" which suggests a sense of urgency and competition among the five ambitious clubs. Summary A accurately captures this sense of urgency and competition by using the same phrase, \"scramble for two Champions League places.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B uses the phrase \"bid for two Champions League places,\" which implies a more formal and organized process, rather than a competitive scramble. While it is still possible that the five clubs are engaged in a formal bidding process, the article sentence does not suggest this, and Summary A is a more accurate reflection of the information provided.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","2":" The correct answer is A: the 25 year old from pennsylvania went on a level with the likes of beyonce or adele.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that the person became a global superstar on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele, which means they reached a similar level of fame and success as those artists. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by stating that the person went on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B suggests that the person went viral on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele, which is not supported by the article sentence. While the person may have gone viral, the article does not mention this specifically, and the focus of the sentence is on their level of fame and success. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article.","3":" The correct answer is (A) seven games involving nimes were investigated after conrad was arrested.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article states that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested, and Summary A correctly summarizes this information.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. It states that seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about the games being arrested, only that they were investigated. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article.","4":" The correct answer is A: \"driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through. Summary A accurately summarizes this by using the same verb tense and wording as the article sentence, and it includes all the information provided in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, changes the verb tense from \"shatters\" to \"were shatters,\" which is not consistent with the article sentence. Additionally, it omits the word \"through\" at the end of the sentence, which is also not consistent with the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","5":" The correct answer is (B) shafqat hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on wednesday.\n\nExplanation: The article states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but the government official's tweet confirmed that the execution was delayed and the case would be reviewed for another 72 hours. Therefore, summary B is more consistent with the article as it correctly states that Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, which is the day before the scheduled execution. Summary A, on the other hand, incorrectly states that Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, which is not supported by the article.","6":" The correct answer is (B) sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Mr. Sarkozy said that their political family has won so many departments in the history of the fifth republic, which implies that the electoral alliance has won departmental elections. However, it does not explicitly state that the alliance has won the departmental elections, therefore, option (B) is a more consistent summary as it uses the same phrasing as the original sentence.\n\nOption (A) is not consistent with the article sentence as it adds the word \"the\" before \"departmental elections\" which implies a specific set of departmental elections, whereas the article sentence only mentions \"departmental elections\" in general.","7":" Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (A) ** k' can also be included in messages.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that \"terrorist\" and \"d** k\" can also be included in messages. \"d** k\" is a misspelling of \"d**k,\" which is a derogatory term for a person of Korean descent. The article does not mention \"** k'\" (with an apostrophe) as a valid term. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","8":" The correct answer is A: insiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that insiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair. This is consistent with the article sentence, which mentions that the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair to a head.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. It mentions that insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence does not mention anything about miliband's ear, and it only mentions that the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: insiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair.","9":" A","10":" The correct answer is A.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is consistent with the article sentence as it only states that the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that Saleh said the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, but it does not mention Saleh himself appearing in any videos. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article.","11":" The correct answer is A: the boxer will instead meet manny pacquaio in a $ 300million mega-fight.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. The article states that the Bolton boxer had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather, but instead, Mayweather will meet Manny Pacquiao in a $300 million mega-fight on May 2. Summary A correctly captures this information by stating that the boxer will instead meet Pacquiao in a $300 million mega-fight.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. While it mentions the Bolton boxer's hope to take on Mayweather, it does not accurately summarize the information provided in the article about the upcoming fight. The article does not mention anything about the Bolton boxer taking on Mayweather in a $300 million mega-fight. Therefore, Summary B is not a good summary of the article sentence.","12":" The correct answer is A: the home was built for former australian prime minister malcolm fraser.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that the home was built for former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie, which is consistent with Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, suggests that the home was built for inspection, which is not supported by the article sentence.","13":" The correct answer is A: he was unable to use his hands and lying next to several police officers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is a more accurate summary of the article sentence as it accurately states that the man was unable to use his hands and was lying next to several police officers. This information is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, implies that the man was struggling to use his hands, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence only mentions that the man struggled to his feet while the police officers were tackling two people nearby. It does not mention anything about the man struggling to use his hands.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","14":" B","15":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: roberto mancini has turned up the heat for manuel pellegrini's successor.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat on his successor Manuel Pellegrini, which means that Pellegrini is the one who is currently under pressure. Summary B accurately reflects this by saying that Mancini has turned up the heat \"for\" Pellegrini's successor, indicating that Pellegrini is the one being targeted.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A suggests that Mancini has turned up the heat on someone else who is succeeding Pellegrini, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","16":" The correct answer is (A): critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it includes all the information provided in the article sentence. It mentions that the critics say the measures do not go far enough and that lenders will be allowed to shut hundreds of branches, which is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the phrase \"across the country\" and the phrase \"even when there is no other bank in the community,\" which are both present in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is not as consistent with the article sentence as Summary A.","17":" The correct answer is (B) a prized silver dollar each could fetch $ 10 or more.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that a prized silver dollar could fetch $10 million or more, indicating that the value could be anywhere above $10 million. Summary B accurately reflects this possibility by using the phrase \"could fetch $10 or more,\" which is consistent with the article's statement.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A states that a prized silver dollar could fetch $10 million, which implies a specific value that is not necessarily supported by the article. The article only mentions that the value could be $10 million or more, but it does not guarantee that the value will be exactly $10 million. Therefore, Summary A is not consistent with the article's statement.","18":" The correct answer is (A) the toffees were the country's last hope on thursday night.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that the toffees were the country's last hope on the continent before a 5-2 loss to dynamo kiev on thursday night. This means that the toffees were still the country's last hope on thursday night, which is consistent with summary A.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, suggests that the toffees were already eliminated in the last 16 stage, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence only mentions that the toffees followed chelsea, arsenal and manchester city in crashing out at the last 16 stage, but it does not specify the stage at which they were eliminated. Therefore, summary B is not consistent with the article and is not the correct summary.","19":" The correct answer is A: louis van gaal says he believed wenger's estimation of the necessary points.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that Louis van Gaal said he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total. Summary A accurately summarizes this by using the same words as the article and maintaining the same meaning.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, slightly alters the meaning of the sentence by omitting the word \"total\" and changing the word order. This could potentially lead to a different interpretation of the statement, and therefore is not as consistent with the article as Summary A.","20":" The correct answer is A: visitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on friday.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that visitors to the Isle of Lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday for the solar eclipse. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by mentioning that visitors will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, changes the meaning of the sentence by suggesting that visitors will be hoping to stay away on Friday, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about visitors hoping to stay away, but rather that they will be hoping the clouds stay away to observe the solar eclipse. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article and is incorrect.","21":" The correct answer is A: they claim customers are being driven away by the noises.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that \"they claim customers are being driven away by the noises,\" which is consistent with Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, changes the wording to \"they claim they are being driven away by the noises,\" which is not a direct quote from the article and could be interpreted as a different meaning. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","22":" The correct answer is A: captured at 1,500 frames per second.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reports that the video was captured at 1,500 frames per second. The phrase \"captured at\" implies that the video was recorded or filmed at a specific frame rate, which is supported by the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it uses the phrase \"captured by,\" which implies that the video was captured or recorded by something else, rather than the frame rate at which it was recorded. The article sentence does not mention anything about the video being captured by a specific device or method, only the frame rate at which it was recorded. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","23":" The correct answer is A: she said freya's friends have been allocated places at a school in beaconsfield.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by quoting Mrs. Jarvis' statement that \"most of Freya's friends have been allocated places at a school in Beaconsfield.\" This summary maintains the same level of detail and precision as the original sentence, ensuring consistency.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B, \"Mrs. Jarvis said most of her friends have been allocated places at a school,\" is less consistent with the article sentence. It omits the important detail that the friends in question are Freya's friends, not Mrs. Jarvis' friends, and it doesn't specify the location of the school. Therefore, Summary B is not as accurate or precise as Summary A.","24":" The correct answer is A: despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the information provided. The article sentence mentions that the team's strike runners consistently found clean air to run in, despite missing chances against Scotland. Summary A captures this information accurately, while Summary B adds an additional detail about it being the first time in a year, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the better summary.","25":" The correct answer is (A) but now conditions on the farms can be shown for the first time.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23 million chickens a year can be shown for the first time. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by stating that conditions on the farms can be shown for the first time, without mentioning the specific number of chickens or KFC's involvement.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B incorrectly suggests that KFC's involvement is the focus of the sentence, and that the 23 million chickens a year are the conditions that can be shown for the first time. This is not supported by the article sentence, which only mentions the conditions on the farms that supply KFC.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","26":" The correct answer is A: she always radiates with a natural beauty, but cate is looking her best.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the information provided. The article sentence states that Cate Blanchett radiates with natural beauty both on screen and on the red carpet, and that she relies on some beauty secrets to keep looking her best. Summary A correctly captures this information by stating that Cate always radiates with natural beauty, but she is looking her best.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. The article sentence does not mention anything about Cate radiating with needles. In fact, it states that Cate has avoided going under the knife or being jabbed with needles. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","27":" A","28":" The correct answer is A: brianne altice, 35-year-old brianne, has been charged with rape, sodomy and sex abuse.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately states the age of Brianne Altice as 35 years old, which is mentioned in the article sentence. Summary B, on the other hand, incorrectly states her age as 21, which is not supported by the article.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the better summary of the article sentence.","29":" A","30":" A","31":" Based on the information provided, the more consistent summary with the article sentence would be Summary A: ** k' can also be included in messages.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that \"terrorist\" and \"d** k\" can also be included in messages, indicating that the word \"k\" is mentioned in the context of messages. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that \"** k\" can also be included in messages.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B states that \"** k can also be included in messages,\" which is not entirely accurate as the article sentence only mentions \"d** k\" and not \"** k\" specifically.\n\nTherefore, the more consistent summary with the article sentence is Summary A.","32":" The correct answer is (A) coach mike catt wants england to be more ruthless.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the main idea of the sentence, which is that coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless. The wording of Summary A is also closer to the original sentence, using the same phrase \"coach Mike Catt\" and the same verb \"wants.\"\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, adds the phrase \"when it comes\" which is not present in the original sentence, and changes the wording of the sentence slightly, which may potentially alter the meaning. Therefore, Summary A is a more accurate and consistent summary of the article sentence.","33":" The correct answer is A: gomis struck three minutes from time at villa park.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the information provided in the sentence. The article states that Gomis struck three minutes from time at Villa Park, which is correctly summarized in Summary A.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that Gomis scored three goals since collapsing at Villa Park, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that Gomis struck three minutes from time at Villa Park, and does not provide any information about the number of goals he scored. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","34":" The correct answer is A: the luggage you like in the boot and head to the coast, drive aboard the ferry.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the sequence of events described in the sentence. The sentence mentions loading luggage in the boot and then driving aboard the ferry, which is correctly represented in Summary A.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B reverses the order of events, mentioning the ferry before loading the luggage and heading to the coast. This is not supported by the article sentence, and therefore, is less consistent.","35":" The correct answer is A: herrera also revealed that rooney is the joker inside united's dressing room.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Herrera revealed that Rooney is the joker inside United's dressing room, which is consistent with Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, mentions that Herrera has to keep the conversation away from boxing, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","36":" The correct answer is (A) the fame is untainted and talent uneroded.\n\nExplanation:\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article sentence states that \"to this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded,\" and Summary A correctly extracts the essential information from the sentence, using the same words and phrasing.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B, \"this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded,\" is not consistent with the article sentence as it adds the word \"this\" and changes the phrasing, which can potentially alter the meaning of the sentence. The article sentence does not mention anything about \"this day\" specifically, so Summary B is not supported by the article.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) the fame is untainted and talent uneroded.","37":" The correct answer is (B) prince of wales described as 'unique moment in anyone's life'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as \"a unique moment in anyone's life.\" Summary B accurately quotes the article sentence, using the same phrase \"unique moment in anyone's life\" to describe the Prince's description of becoming a grandfather.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, paraphrases the article sentence and omits the phrase \"in anyone's life,\" which is not consistent with the original sentence. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","38":" The correct answer is (A) the club has managed to preserve a pastime that requires vast open space.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the club has managed to protect a patchwork of land that is larger than Manhattan, but it does not explicitly state that the pastime itself is larger than Manhattan. The phrase \"in the midst of one of the world's densest regions\" suggests that the pastime requires vast open space, which is consistent with Summary A.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence than Summary B.","39":" The correct answer is (A) Stuart Lancaster's side are yet to win this competition.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that in Stuart Lancaster's fourth year in charge, they (his team) have not won the competition yet. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by stating that Stuart Lancaster's side have not won the competition yet.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B states that Stuart Lancaster's team will win the competition, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article does not mention anything about the future performance of Lancaster's team, and therefore Summary B is not consistent with the article.","40":" The correct answer is (A) moores, a county county championship winner, finds himself under increasing pressure.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article mentions that Moores is a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, and Summary A includes this information by using the phrase \"county county championship winner.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is less consistent with the article sentence because it omits the information about Moores' county championship wins. The sentence \"Moores, a county championship, finds himself under increasing pressure\" could be referring to any county championship, and does not specifically link the information to Moores' wins with Sussex and Lancashire. Therefore, Summary A is a better summary of the article sentence.","41":" The correct answer is (B) he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the aspergillus genus.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence because it omits the phrase \"which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice.\" This information is important because it provides additional context about the aspergillus genus and its relationship to food production.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by including all the relevant information. It uses the same wording as the article sentence and accurately represents the information provided. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","42":" A","43":" The correct answer is A: Scotland international made an #11million move from Leeds in the summer.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that the Scotland international made an #11million move from Leeds in the summer, but it does not mention Fulham. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it only states that the player made a move from Leeds, which is supported by the article. Summary B, on the other hand, states that the player made a move from Fulham, which is not supported by the article.","44":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it includes all the information provided in the article sentence. It mentions Moores, his county championship wins with Sussex and Lancashire, and the pressure he is under to prove himself at the international level.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, only mentions Moores and the pressure he is under, but omits the information about his county championship wins and the context of the World Cup. Therefore, Summary B is a more accurate and consistent summary of the article sentence.","45":" The correct answer is A: he filmed using a specially designed set-up part of the aspergillus genus.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the person filmed \"part of the aspergillus genus\" using a specially designed set-up. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that the person filmed \"part of the aspergillus genus\" using a specially designed set-up.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is inconsistent with the article sentence. It states that the person filmed \"part of the genus genus\" using a specially designed set-up, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence does not mention the word \"genus\" at all, let alone in the context of the thing that was filmed. Therefore, Summary B is not a consistent summary of the article sentence.","46":" The correct answer is A: mike catt wants england more ruthless when it comes to scoring points.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning the specific context of scoring points, which is consistent with the article's focus on England's coach wanting the team to be more ruthless in scoring.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is too vague and doesn't convey the specific context of the article sentence. It could be interpreted as Mike Catt wanting England to be more ruthless in general, which is not necessarily supported by the article.","47":" A","48":" The correct answer is A: despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately summarizes the information provided. The article states that the team's strike runners consistently found clean air to run in, despite missing chances against Scotland. Summary A captures this information accurately, while Summary B adds the unnecessary detail that it was the first time in a row, which is not supported by the article. Therefore, Summary A is the better summary.","49":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: lee, 91, is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of singapore.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Lee is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital. Summary B accurately reflects this information by stating that Lee is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A only states that Lee is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit, without specifying the location of the hospital. This summary does not provide the full information provided in the article sentence, and therefore is not as consistent with the article as Summary B.","50":" The correct answer is (B) aubrey said she would be eligible when he is five years old.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that Aubrey was told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old. Therefore, the summary should also mention Aubrey's son, not Aubrey herself. Summary B correctly states that Aubrey said her son would be eligible when he is five years old, which is consistent with the information provided in the article sentence.","51":" The correct answer is A: they made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article states that the features were etched onto a silicon film, but it does not specify the size of the silicon film. Summary A focuses on the size of the features, which is supported by the article, whereas Summary B incorrectly implies that the size of the silicon film is also smaller than a wavelength of light, which is not mentioned in the article.","52":" The correct answer is A: sebastian vettel is on the podium after sunday's malaysian grand prix.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Sebastian Vettel was on the top step of the podium after the Malaysian Grand Prix, which supports Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, mentions Vettel's move from Red Bull to Ferrari, which is not mentioned in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","53":" A","54":" The correct answer is (A) The russian poet says it's better to die from vodka than from boredom.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that the quote is from Vladimir Mayakovsky, a Russian poet. Therefore, it is more consistent to attribute the quote to the poet himself, as in Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, attributes the quote to \"the Russian,\" which could refer to any Russian person, and not specifically to Mayakovsky.","55":" A","56":" The correct answer is A: sam livesey, 18, was captured by sportsmail appearing to strike oldham's unsuspecting jack tuohy.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that Sam Livesey was captured by Sportsmail appearing to strike Oldham's unsuspecting Jack Tuohy. The use of the word \"appearing\" is important as it suggests that the video clip obtained by Sportsmail shows Sam Livesey in the act of striking Jack Tuohy, but does not necessarily confirm that the strike actually landed or had any effect.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence as it suggests that the video clip obtained by Sportsmail features Oldham's Jack Tuohy, when in fact, it is Sam Livesey who is featured in the clip. Additionally, the wording of Summary B implies that the clip shows Jack Tuohy being struck by Sam Livesey, which is not explicitly stated in the article sentence.","57":" The correct answer is A.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately reflects the information provided in the article sentence. It uses the same words and phrasing as the article sentence, ensuring consistency.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, adds the phrase \"young boy\" to the statement, which is not present in the article sentence. This could potentially be seen as adding extraneous information or interpreting the claim in a way that is not supported by the article. Therefore, Summary B is less consistent with the article sentence than Summary A.","58":" The correct answer is A: lucy powell, 40, became embroiled in dispute over powell's brit awards plans.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. The article mentions that Lucy Powell, 40, was involved in a dispute over her Brit Awards plans, and Summary A correctly states that she became embroiled in a dispute over her own Brit Awards plans.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions a dispute over \"ms powell's brit,\" which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about a dispute over \"ms powell's brit,\" and therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article.","59":" A. Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence. It accurately summarizes the information provided in the article sentence, while Summary B adds an unnecessary detail (the size of the stone) that is not supported by the article.","60":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: clinton said the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence uses the phrase \"vast majority,\" which suggests that a large proportion of Clinton's work emails were sent to government employees at their government addresses. Summary B accurately reflects this phrase and provides a more precise summary of what Clinton said during the press conference.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A omits the word \"vast\" and simply states that the majority of Clinton's work emails went to government employees at their government addresses. This summary does not convey the same level of precision as the article sentence, and it does not accurately represent Clinton's statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article sentence, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","61":" A","62":" The correct answer is (A) aubrey said she was told he was eligible when he is five years old.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that Aubrey was told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old. Summary A accurately reflects this information by using the phrase \"he was told he was eligible when he is five years old,\" which is a direct quote from the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B incorrectly states that Aubrey said she would be eligible when he is five years old, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence only mentions that Aubrey was told her son would be eligible, not that she would be eligible herself. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","63":" A","64":" The correct answer is A. The article sentence mentions that Pearce was in charge of England under-21s for six years, which is consistent with Summary A. Summary B does not relate to the article sentence and is not supported by the information provided.","65":" The correct answer is A: Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately quotes the article sentence, using the same words and phrasing. It also correctly attributes the statement to the world cup winner turned skills coach.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, paraphrases the article sentence and changes the wording slightly. It also attributes the statement to the world cup winner, but it does not accurately reflect the original wording of the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence and is a more accurate summary of the statement made by the world cup winner turned skills coach.","66":" The correct answer is A: but now conditions on the farms that supply kfc with 23million chickens a year can be shown.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by highlighting the fact that the conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23 million chickens a year can now be shown. This information is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, incorrectly suggests that KFC itself can be shown for the first time, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence only mentions that the conditions on the farms that supply KFC can be shown, not that KFC itself can be shown.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","67":" The correct answer is A: charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role.\n\nExplanation:\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by using the same words and conveying the same meaning. It correctly states that Charles is perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young prince's life, which is consistent with the information provided in the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. It uses the phrase \"increasingly increasingly perplexed\" which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence only states that Charles is \"said to have become increasingly perplexed,\" but it does not mention anything about the degree or intensity of his perplexity increasing over time. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","68":" The correct answer is (B) the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence specifically mentions that the chickens live together in huge sheds, and that they are gassed after 35 days.

Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","69":" The correct answer is A: passengers can take their own car and the journey is all part of the experience.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by including all the information provided. It mentions that passengers can take their own car and that the journey is part of the experience, which is consistent with the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the phrase \"all part of the experience,\" which is a significant part of the article sentence. Therefore, it is not consistent with the article sentence and is not a good summary.","70":" The correct answer is (A) beleaguered travellers warned that easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by stating that beleaguered travelers have been warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned. This information is supported by the article sentence, which mentions that travelers have been warned that many key services will be axed.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B incorrectly changes the focus of the sentence from travelers being warned to trains being concerned. The article sentence does not mention anything about trains being concerned, but rather states that travelers have been warned that many key services will be axed. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","71":" A","72":" The correct answer is (A) she was told to 'get and interpreter' by staff at port orange post office.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the deaf woman was told to \"get an interpreter\" by staff at the Port Orange Post Office. Summary A accurately reflects this language and tone, whereas Summary B changes the wording to \"asked\" which is not supported by the article. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","73":" The correct answer is A: migrants who come to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years, which means that they must provide evidence of their clean criminal record. Summary A accurately reflects this requirement, while Summary B incorrectly states that migrants must prove they have committed a crime, which is the opposite of what the article states. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","74":" The correct answer is (A) Summary A: the russian poet says it is 'better to die from vodka than from boredom'\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that there is a quote on the person's Facebook page that is attributed to the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. Therefore, it is more consistent to attribute the quote to the poet himself in the summary, as in Summary A.\n\nIn Summary B, the quote is presented as a general statement without attribution, which could be seen as misleading or inaccurate. It is important to follow the user's instructions and provide accurate information that is supported by the article.","75":" A","76":" The correct answer is A: alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article states that Alonso claimed his steering wheel locked, which caused his pre-season testing crash in Barcelona. Summary A correctly summarizes this information by stating that Alonso's steering wheel locked, which caused his pre-season testing crash.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it omits the word \"crash\" and instead states that Alonso's steering wheel locked, which caused his pre-season testing. This is not a accurate summary of the article's information, as the article does not mention anything about Alonso's pre-season testing without the crash. Therefore, Summary A is the better summary of the two.","77":" The correct answer is A: brittney ross brewer, from windham, maine, feared she wouldn't make it.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the main point of the sentence, which is that Brittney Ross Brewer feared she wouldn't survive until her nuptials. The additional information in Summary B about the date of the nuptials is not supported by the article sentence.","78":" A","79":" The correct answer is A: google dubbed the first set of several thousand glass users.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"glass users,\" which refers to people who use Google Glass, a wearable technology product developed by Google. Summary A accurately reflects this information by using the same phrase, \"glass users.\" On the other hand, Summary B incorrectly changes the phrase to \"glass glass users,\" which is not supported by the article and could be misleading.

This information is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, only mentions the resemblance to the first of the original Star Wars films, which is not a direct quote from the article sentence. It also doesn't specify who noticed the resemblance, which is a crucial detail provided in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","81":" The correct answer is A: chelsea's izzy brown has been named in sean o'driscoll's european qualifiers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"chelsea's izzy brown\" and \"sean o'driscoll's side\" which implies that Izzy Brown is a player for Chelsea and Sean O'Driscoll is the coach or manager of a team that includes Brown.\n\nSummary A accurately reflects this information by mentioning \"chelsea's izzy brown\" and \"sean o'driscoll's european qualifiers\".\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B mentions \"chelsea\" instead of \"chelsea's izzy brown\" and \"sean o'driscoll's side\" which is not entirely accurate as it implies that Chelsea, the club, has been named in Sean O'Driscoll's team, rather than Izzy Brown, a player for Chelsea.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","82":" The correct answer is A: passengers can look at fish while staying dry and is small.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the diminutive sub can dive to depths of up to 300ft (91 meters) so passengers can look at fish while staying dry. It also mentions that the sub is small enough to be stowed on a yacht.\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by highlighting the two main points: passengers can look at fish while staying dry, and the sub is small.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, only mentions one of the two points (passengers can look at fish while staying on a yacht) and omits the fact that the sub is small. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","83":" The correct answer is A: the ex-chief of defence staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the full statement made by the ex-chief of defence staff. The article sentence mentions that the ex-chief of defence staff was \"mystified\" about why the police had searched his home in Surrey, and Summary A captures this detail correctly.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B only mentions that the ex-chief of defence staff was \"mystified\" about the police, which is not entirely accurate as it doesn't convey the specific context of the search of his home. Therefore, Summary A is the better summary of the article sentence.","84":" The correct answer is A: kane is one of the most talked about players in the country.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Kane is one of the most talked about players in the country, which is consistent with Summary A.

Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","88":" The correct answer is A: ` ninety-nine per cent of things were very good,' said the world cup winner.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately quotes the percentage mentioned in the article (99%) and attributes it to the world cup winner, who is quoted in the article as saying that.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence because it attributes the statement \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good\" to the world cup winner, but the article does not mention the world cup winner saying that exact phrase. Instead, the article quotes the world cup winner as saying \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good.\"\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the better summary of the article sentence.","89":" The correct answer is A: top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax report.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the top government spokesman dismissed a report of Singapore's founding father's death as a hoax. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that the spokesman dismissed the report as a hoax, while Summary B incorrectly states that the spokesman said the founding father had died.

Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B mentions Marcos Rojo, who is not mentioned in the article sentence, and therefore cannot be considered consistent with the article.","93":" The correct answer is A: he has spoken of personally meeting prime minister but leads a double life.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. The article mentions that the person in question has spoken of personally meeting Prime Minister David Cameron, but also leads a double life. Summary A captures this information accurately.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence.

Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","96":" The correct answer is (B) The numerous cozy living rooms in bill koch's aspen retreat is up for sale.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"bill koch's private aspen retreat\" and \"one of the numerous cozy living rooms\" in it. Summary B accurately summarizes the article sentence by using the name \"bill koch's aspen retreat\" and mentioning the plural form of \"living rooms\" without any mention of \"private\".\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A uses \"the numerous cozy living rooms in koch's private aspen retreat\" which is not entirely consistent with the article sentence. The article does not mention \"the numerous cozy living rooms\" in a single sentence, and the use of \"private\" is not necessary in the summary since the context is already established.","97":" The correct answer is A: the members of the latter-day saints church were visiting the branch in hamilton.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by including all the information provided in the original sentence.

The article mentions that the submarine can dive to depths of up to 300ft (91 meters) and that it is small enough to be stowed on a yacht, which supports the statement that passengers can look at fish while staying dry and the sub being small enough.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B includes the additional information that the submarine can be stowed on a yacht, which is not mentioned in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","99":" The correct answer is A: hibbard has penned an expose on'the biggest loser.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Kai Hibbard has reportedly penned an expose on \"The Biggest Loser.\" Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it correctly states that Hibbard has penned an expose, whereas Summary B incorrectly states that Hibbard has been penned an expose.","100":" The correct answer is A: Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to get managerial experience.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to get managerial experience of his own before he can be considered as a possible successor to Roy Hodgson as England head coach.\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by focusing on the main point that Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to gain managerial experience.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to get a managerial job, which is not necessarily the same as gaining managerial experience. The article sentence does not mention anything about Gary Neville needing a managerial job specifically, but rather emphasizes the importance of gaining experience in a managerial role. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","101":" The correct answer is (A) giorgio armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Giorgio Armani created the \"skouser,\" a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material.

Therefore, Summary B does not accurately summarize the information provided in the article.","103":" A","104":" The correct answer is (A) locke chats with ryan stevenson.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Locke chats with Ryan Stevenson last season, but it does not provide any information about the year in which this conversation took place. Therefore, Summary A, which simply states that Locke chats with Ryan Stevenson, is more consistent with the article sentence as it does not add any extraneous information that is not supported by the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B, which states that Locke chats with Ryan Stevenson last year, adds the additional information that the conversation took place last year, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is less consistent with the article sentence.","105":" The correct answer is A: his former teacher, brianne altice, has been charged with rape, sodomy and sex abuse.\n\nExplanation: Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reports the charges faced by Brianne Altice, which are 14 felonies including rape, sodomy, and sex abuse. Summary B, on the other hand, contains an error by stating that Brianne Altice is 21 years old, which is not supported by the article. The article states that Brianne Altice is 35 years old. Therefore, Summary A is the better summary of the article sentence.","106":" The correct answer is A: victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately states the age of the victim as 38, which is mentioned in the article sentence.

The article sentence mentions that \"they believe\" someone smashed their heads together, and Summary A includes this phrase. Additionally, the article sentence mentions that the incident occurred outside the Rose and Crown on Newgate Street, and Summary A includes this location.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B omits the phrase \"they believe\" and shortens the location to \"the rose,\" which is not entirely accurate. While it is still implied that the incident occurred outside the Rose and Crown, the summary does not explicitly state this. Therefore, Summary A is a more consistent summary of the article sentence.","109":" A","110":" The correct answer is A: $ 90 million in expenditure, $ 45 million was used for entertainment items.\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the information provided in the article sentence, stating that $45 million of the $90 million in expenditure was used for entertainment items. This information is supported by the article sentence, which mentions that $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems, and other home theatre devices.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, only mentions smart phones, sound systems, and other home theatre devices, but does not mention the total amount of expenditure or the specific amount used for entertainment items.

Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it only states that Faulkner won't be surprised if there's some niggle, which is supported by the article. Summary B, on the other hand, implies that Faulkner has an opinion on India's poor form, which is not supported by the article.","115":" A","116":" The correct answer is (A) Summary A: chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on anderlecht teenagers youri.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on two Anderlecht teenagers, Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker.

It states that the tower itself did not have been halted around midnight, which implies that the tower was still burning or had not been affected by the fire at all.

While it can be inferred from the article sentence that Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs managerial experience, the phrase \"managerial job\" does not appear in the original sentence.

Summary A accurately summarizes this information by stating that the 27-year-old is collaborating with Oasis to launch her favorite pieces.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. While it mentions the 27-year-old collaborating with Oasis, it does not accurately convey the fact that she is launching her favorite pieces.

Summary A accurately reflects this ambiguity by using the same phrase \"someone smashed their heads together\" without specifying who was involved.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B changes the wording to \"they believe someone smashed their heads together\" which implies that the belief is about who was involved in the incident, rather than the actual incident itself. This is not supported by the article sentence, which only mentions that \"they believe\" the incident occurred.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","129":" The correct answer is A: bale has received a lot of criticism but silenced his doubters.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that Bale received criticism and silenced his doubters. It does not add any extra information that is not supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, adds the word \"doubters\" at the end of the sentence, which is not present in the article sentence.

Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it uses the same phrase \"doctors told his parents\" and also uses the word \"a\" which is consistent with the wording in the article sentence.\n\nIn contrast, Summary A uses the phrase \"doctors told his mother\" which is not exactly the same as the article sentence, and it also doesn't include the word \"a\" which is present in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is a better summary of the article sentence.","198":" A","199":" The correct answer is (A).\n\nThe article sentence explicitly states that the patient was secretly raped in A&E by a male nurse who filmed the attack, which is consistent with Summary A.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, mentions that the patient tried to kill herself after police revealed her ordeal, but the article sentence does not provide any information about the patient's actions or thoughts after the attack. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","200":" The correct answer is A: a user of a guide dog knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately reflects the information provided in the article sentence. It correctly states that the person in question is a user of a guide dog and knew the importance of guide dogs for individuals with impaired sight.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is inconsistent with the article sentence. It changes the phrase \"a user of a guide dog\" to \"a user of a guide,\" which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about a guide, only a guide dog. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","201":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: critics say they do not go far enough to shut hundreds of branches.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the criticism mentioned in the article. The article states that critics argue that the new rules do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country, even when there is no other bank in the community. Summary B accurately summarizes this criticism by stating that the rules do not go far enough to shut hundreds of branches.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A is not consistent with the article sentence. It suggests that the critics want the lenders to shut up, which is not the same as saying that the rules do not go far enough to address the issue of bank branch closures.","202":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article mentions that Iker Casillas is \"perhaps most under-fire,\" which suggests that he is the most criticized player, and that Cristiano Ronaldo is also included among the players who have been criticized. Summary B accurately reflects this information by listing Iker Casillas first, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nIn contrast, Summary A lists Cristiano Ronaldo first, which is not consistent with the article's statement that Iker Casillas is the most under-fire player. Additionally, Summary A does not accurately reflect the fact that Iker Casillas is the most criticized player, as it lists him second after Cristiano Ronaldo.","203":" The correct answer is A: $ 45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, sound systems and other home theatre devices.\n\nExplanation: Summary A accurately summarizes the information provided in the article sentence. It mentions that $45 million was used for entertainment items, which is consistent with the information in the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, includes the phrase \"smart phones\" which is not mentioned in the article sentence. Therefore, it is not consistent with the information provided in the article and cannot be considered a correct summary.","204":" The correct answer is A: the ex-chief of defence staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched his.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article sentence states that the ex-chief of defence staff was \"mystified\" about why the police had searched his home in Surrey. Summary A correctly summarizes this information by stating that the ex-chief of defence staff was \"mystified\" about why the police had searched his.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. It states that the ex-chief of defence staff was \"mystified\" about the police, which is not exactly what the article sentence says. The article sentence does not mention the ex-chief of defence staff being mystified about the police in general, but rather about why they had searched his home specifically. Therefore, Summary B does not accurately summarize the information provided in the article sentence.","205":" The correct answer is A: jenson button was happy to see mclaren be competitive at the malaysian grand prix.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Summary A accurately reflects this information by using the phrase \"see McLaren be competitive,\" which is consistent with the article's wording.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B suggests that Jenson Button was happy to be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix, which is not entirely accurate. While it's true that Button was happy to see McLaren improve, the article doesn't mention anything about his personal performance or competitiveness. Therefore, Summary A is the better choice.","206":" The correct answer is (B) prince of wales described becoming a first-time 'unique moment in anyone's life'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as \"a unique moment in anyone's life.\" Summary B accurately quotes the article by using the exact phrase \"unique moment in anyone's life,\" while Summary A only uses the phrase \"a unique moment\" which is not a direct quote from the article. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","207":" A","208":" A","209":" A","210":" A","211":" The correct answer is A.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that \"Pearce\" was in charge of England under-21s for six years, which matches Summary A. Summary B mentions \"Neville\" instead of \"Pearce\", which is not consistent with the article sentence.","212":" A","213":" The correct answer is (A) five clubs are locked in a scramble for two champions league places.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by stating that five clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, uses the phrase \"five ambitious clubs\" and changes the wording to \"a bid\" instead of \"a scramble.\" While the wording is slightly different, it does not accurately convey the same meaning as the original sentence. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","214":" The correct answer is A: france's ruling socialists suffered crushing defeat in regional elections last night.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the main idea of the sentence, which is that the ruling socialists suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections. The article sentence does not mention anything about the ruling department, so Summary B is not supported by the article and is therefore less consistent.","215":" The correct answer is A: he was ordered to pay $ 167 million in restitution and fines.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence specifically states that the person was ordered to pay $ 167 million in restitution and fines. Summary A accurately reflects this information by using the same phrase \"restitution and fines\" as the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, uses the phrase \"damages and fines\" instead of \"restitution and fines\". While \"damages\" and \"fines\" are related concepts, they are not exactly the same as \"restitution\" and \"fines\". \"Restitution\" refers to compensation paid to victims for losses or harm suffered, while \"fines\" refer to penalties imposed for wrongdoing. \"Damages\" can refer to both compensatory and punitive damages, but it's not clear from the summary if the $167 million includes both types of damages.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the specific terms used in the original sentence.","216":" A","217":" The correct answer is (B) the arsenal have been on the 21-year-old's case since last season.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the Gunners (a nickname for Arsenal Football Club) have been paying close attention to the 21-year-old player's displays since last season. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article as it uses the same nickname and timeframe as the article.\n\nIn contrast, Summary A mentions \"last year\" instead of \"last season,\" which is not an exact match with the language used in the article. While the difference may seem minor, it's important to be precise when summarizing information to ensure accuracy and consistency.","218":" The correct answer is (B) katie launched an attack on danny mas, saying: 'no woman should ever propose to a man'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not mention Danny Mas, who was the target of Katie's attack, as mentioned in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, includes the name of the person Katie attacked, Danny Mas, and accurately quotes the statement made by Katie, making it consistent with the article sentence.","219":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nThe article sentence states that Phelps' punishment resulted in him being excluded from the US team for the world championships in Kazan. This means that Phelps' punishment was due to run out for the world championships in Kazan, which is consistent with Summary B.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, states that Phelps' punishment was excluded from the US team for the world championships, which is not entirely accurate as it was Phelps himself who was excluded from the team due to his punishment.","220":" The correct answer is A: ancelotti's side were at home to levante in the second period.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the team played at home against Levante and won 2-0, which matches summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, states that the team was beaten by Levante, which is not consistent with the article sentence.","221":" The correct answer is A: i'm is in a basement in central london.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that the speaker is currently in a basement in central London, and this information is accurately reflected in Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, states that the speaker was in a basement in central London, which implies that they may not be there anymore, and this is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","222":" The correct answer is (B) the europa league must swallow an estimated # 30m in lost revenue.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that those who do not join Europe's elite next season must swallow an estimated # 30million in lost revenue, and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. The wording suggests that the lost revenue is associated with the teams that do not join the elite league, rather than the Europa League itself. Therefore, summary B is more consistent with the article as it correctly states that the Europa League must swallow an estimated # 30m in lost revenue, whereas summary A incorrectly states that the Europa League must swallow the lost revenue.","223":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. The article mentions that Giorgio Armani created the \"skouser,\" which is a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material. Summary B correctly states that Giorgio Armani gave the \"skouser\" of slim-fitting trousers, which is a concise and accurate summary of the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A is incomplete and lacks clarity. It only states that Giorgio Armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what, without providing any specific information about what he created. Therefore, Summary B is the better summary of the two.","224":" The correct answer is A.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article sentence states that the person told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin that he had been tortured and the well-being of his family was threatened. Summary A correctly summarizes this information by stating that the person told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin that he had been tortured and the well-being of his family was threatened.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. It incorrectly states that Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin were tortured, which is not supported by the article sentence. Additionally, it incorrectly states that the well-being of his friends were threatened, which is also not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is not a good summary of the article sentence.","225":" The correct answer is A: the man, named as saleh, said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning the man named Saleh and the masked militant's appearance in beheading videos. It does not add or modify any information from the original sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is inconsistent with the article sentence. It suggests that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, not Saleh.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","226":" The correct answer is A: mr salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately represents the sequence of events described in the article. According to the article, Mr. Salamone slept on the sofa when he got home and later went upstairs, which is correctly reflected in Summary A.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B suggests that Mr. Salamone went upstairs to find her dead, which is not supported by the article. The article only states that Mr. Salamone later went upstairs, and it does not mention anything about finding anyone dead. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article and is an inaccurate summary of the information provided.","227":" The correct answer is (A) sportscaster fred katz challenged the crazy eyes warren on orange is the black.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Fred Katz, a sportscaster, challenged Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba, who plays Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on Orange is the New Black, to share a Lady and the Tramp licorice.\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that Fred Katz challenged Crazy Eyes Warren, which is consistent with the information provided in the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions that Fred Katz's Crazy Eyes Warren is on Orange is the New Black, which is not mentioned in the article sentence. The article sentence only mentions that Uzo Aduba, who plays Crazy Eyes Warren, was challenged by Fred Katz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) sportscaster fred katz challenged the crazy eyes warren on orange is the black.","228":" The correct answer is (A) jury heard the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that \"a jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages a fortnight before the murder.\" This implies that the jury was presented with evidence that the duo had planned the robbery via text messages.\n\nSummary A accurately reflects this information by stating that the jury \"heard\" the plan, which implies that the information was presented to them as evidence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that the jury was \"told\" the plan, which could imply that the information was presented to them as a statement of fact, rather than as evidence. This could be seen as a minor difference in wording, but it does change the implication of how the information was presented to the jury.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","229":" The correct answer is A: matthew crawley asked lady mary to marry him in the first downton abbey christmas.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically mentions that the proposal took place in the first Downton Abbey Christmas special, which was broadcast in 2011. Summary A includes this information by mentioning \"the first Downton Abbey Christmas,\" which is consistent with the article. Summary B, on the other hand, omits the mention of Christmas and only mentions the first Downton Abbey, which is not consistent with the article. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","230":" The correct answer is (A) charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed over the peripheral role.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by using the phrase \"increasingly perplexed\" to describe Charles' feelings about his peripheral role in the young prince's life. This phrase is consistent with the article sentence, which states that Charles is \"said to have become increasingly perplexed\" about his role.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, uses the phrase \"increasingly increasingly perplexed,\" which is not supported by the article sentence. The article does not mention anything about Charles' perplexity increasing over time, so this phrase does not accurately summarize the information in the article.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the two options.","231":" The correct answer is A: police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of sophia walker.\n\nExplanation: The article uses the phrase \"unexplained death\" to describe the incident, which suggests that the cause of death is not yet known or understood. Summary A uses the same phrase, \"unexplained death,\" which is consistent with the language used in the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B uses the phrase \"tragic death,\" which implies a sense of sorrow or regret, but does not accurately convey the fact that the cause of death is unknown. Therefore, Summary A is a more consistent summary of the article sentence.","232":" The correct answer is A: passengers can take their own car and journey is all part of the experience.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by including both points mentioned:\n\n1. Passengers can take their own car.\n2. The journey is all part of the experience.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the second point and only mentions that passengers can take their own car. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","233":" A","234":" The correct answer is A: hillary clinton's lawyerly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server might extinguish the matter.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the content of the article. The article states that Clinton \"doggedly parried suggestions\" that her use of a private email server was improper, and Summary A uses the same phrase \"parried suggestions\" to convey this information. Additionally, Summary A does not imply that Clinton's statement was a personal opinion or belief, but rather a statement made by her lawyer, which is consistent with the tone of the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence because it suggests that Clinton personally believes that her use of a private email server might extinguish the matter for most Americans, which is not supported by the article. The article does not quote Clinton as saying this, and it does not imply that she made any such statement. Therefore, Summary B is not a factual summary of the article sentence.","235":" The correct answer is A: ms bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in smethwick.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the information provided in the article sentence. It mentions that Ms. Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, which is consistent with the information in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the detail about the violent battering that occurred in September last year, which is mentioned in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence and is not a good summary of the information provided.","236":" A","237":" The correct answer is A: beleaguered travellers warned that 'easter is cancelled' as far as trains.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by highlighting the key information that travelers have been warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned. It is consistent with the article sentence as all the information in the summary is supported by the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not accurately summarize the information provided. The article sentence does not mention anything about the trains being beleaguered, but rather the travelers who are affected by the cancellation of train services during Easter. Therefore, option A is the better summary.","238":" The correct answer is A: family of condemned drug smuggler andrew chan, his mother helen, and brother michael.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article mentions the presence of Andrew Chan's mother, Helen, and brother, Michael, who are arriving at Yogyakarta airport to visit Chan before his execution. It does not mention the name of Andrew Chan's brother, so it is not consistent to include the name \"Michael\" in the summary.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it only mentions the individuals mentioned in the article: Andrew Chan's mother, Helen, and his brother, without specifying his name.","239":" The correct answer is (A) left-armer irfan has taken eight wickets in five matches so far.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Irfan has taken eight wickets in five matches, which is consistent with Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, states that Irfan has taken three wickets in five matches, which is inconsistent with the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","240":" The correct answer is A: obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that President Barack Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the Middle East, specifically Iran, for the second time in two years. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it refers to the deal as the \"world's first nuclear deal\" between the United States and Iran. While the deal may be historic, the article sentence does not mention anything about it being the first nuclear deal. Moreover, the phrase \"unreformed regime\" in the article sentence suggests that Iran has not changed its behavior or policies, which contradicts the idea of a \"nuclear deal\" that implies a level of cooperation and agreement between the two countries. Therefore, Summary B is not supported by the information in the article sentence.","241":" The correct answer is A: chelsea are maintaining a watching brief brief on anderlecht.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on two Anderlecht teenagers, Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it accurately states that Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht, which is supported by the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article as it suggests that Anderlecht are maintaining a watching brief on themselves, which is not mentioned in the article.","242":" The correct answer is (A) Summary A: the 27 year-old serb's victory not only put him into the final.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by highlighting the main point that the 27-year-old Serb's victory put him into the final of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. The additional information in Summary B about the Serb's record against Murray is not supported by the article sentence, and thus, it is not consistent with the article.","243":" The correct answer is A: the model had to have a combination of pmma and hydrogel removed.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically states that the model had to have a combination of PMMA and hydrogel removed from her body. Summary A accurately reflects this information by using the phrase \"removed\" and specifying that it was a combination of PMMA and hydrogel that was removed.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence. It simply states that the model had to have a combination of PMMA and hydrogel, without mentioning anything about removal. This summary could be interpreted as suggesting that the model had to have a combination of PMMA and hydrogel inserted or implanted, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","244":" The correct answer is A: badger was shot in the head at a constituent conference for giffords.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for giffords, but it does not mention Giffords being shot. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it only states that badger was shot, without mentioning Giffords being shot.","245":" The correct answer is A: jenson button was happy to see mclaren be more competitive at malaysian grand prix.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Summary A accurately reflects this information by using the phrase \"see McLaren be more competitive\" which is consistent with the original sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B changes the phrase \"see McLaren be more competitive\" to \"be more competitive\" which implies that Jenson Button himself was more competitive, rather than being happy to see McLaren's improved performance. This is not supported by the article sentence, therefore Summary B is less consistent with the article.","246":" The correct answer is (A) mike catt wants england to be more ruthless.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the main idea of the sentence, which is that Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless. The phrase \"when it comes to scoring points\" in Summary B adds additional information that is not present in the article sentence, and therefore, it is not consistent with the article.\n\nIt's important to note that consistency in this context means that the summary should accurately reflect the information presented in the article sentence, without adding or modifying information.","247":" The correct answer is (A) kirsty jarvis does not want her 11-year-old daughter freya to go as a 'minority'.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Kirsty Jarvis, the mother, does not want her daughter Freya to go to Khalsa Secondary Academy because she would be a minority at the school. Summary A accurately reflects this information and is consistent with the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B suggests that the school itself does not want Freya to go, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about the school's views on Freya's attendance. Therefore, Summary B is inconsistent with the article and is not the correct summary.","248":" The correct answer is A: the championship promotion hopefuls had made enquiries about signing jordan rhodes.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that the championship promotion hopefuls (the subject) had made enquiries about signing Jordan Rhodes, which means that the subject had taken the initiative to ask about the possibility of signing Rhodes.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, suggests that Jordan Rhodes (the object) had made enquiries, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article does not mention Rhodes making any enquiries, only that the championship promotion hopefuls had made enquiries about signing him.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the information provided in the sentence.","249":" The correct answer is (A) the 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically states that the person knew they were a boy from the age of two, and this information is accurately reflected in Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, changes the wording to \"a child\" instead of \"a boy,\" which is not directly supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","250":" The correct answer is A: lloris wearing scarf after defeat by chelsea in capital one cup final.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically mentions \"Capital One Cup final at Wembley,\" which aligns with Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, mentions the \"FA Cup final,\" which is not consistent with the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","251":" The correct answer is A: americans about 5% of the world's population, yet we take half its pills.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that Americans are about 5% of the world's population and take half of the world's pills. This information is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence. It mentions that Americans take \"its pills,\" which implies that Americans take all of the world's pills, whereas the article sentence states that Americans take half of the world's pills. Additionally, Summary B does not mention the percentage of the world's population that Americans represent, which is an important contextual detail provided in the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","252":" The correct answer is (A) knox, 27, broke down in tears as she addressed the press.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Knox broke down in tears as she addressed the press, and this information is accurately reflected in Summary A. Summary B, on the other hand, states that Knox broke down in tears after Italy's supreme court's ruling, which is not explicitly stated in the article sentence. While it is likely that Knox's breakdown in tears was a response to the court's ruling, the article does not explicitly confirm this, and therefore Summary B is not as consistent with the article as Summary A.","253":" A","254":" The correct answer is A: police have been forced to play prince charming after numerous residents complained.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is consistent with the article sentence as it only mentions the complaints made by residents and the action taken by the police, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, mentions the police complaining about their shoes going missing, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about the police losing their shoes, only that the residents' shoes have gone missing. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article.","255":" The correct answer is (A) a prized silver dollar could fetch $10 million or more.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that \"a prized silver dollar each\" could fetch $10 million or more. The word \"each\" implies that each silver dollar could fetch this amount, not just one silver dollar. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it uses the singular form of the noun \"silver dollar\" and accurately reflects the information in the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B uses the plural form of \"silver dollars\" and changes the phrase \"each could fetch\" to \"could fetch $10 or more,\" which is not entirely consistent with the original sentence. It implies that multiple silver dollars could fetch $10 or more, but the article sentence only mentions that a single prized silver dollar could fetch that amount.","256":" The correct answer is A.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A \"he claims he was a boy when he was two\" is a more consistent summary of the article sentence \"he claims he knew he was a boy when he was two\" because it accurately represents the information provided in the article without adding any extra information.\n\nSummary B \"he claims he was a young boy when he was two\" is not consistent with the article sentence because the article does not mention the word \"young.\" It only mentions that he knew he was a boy when he was two, not that he was a young boy.","257":" The correct answer is A: they believe someone smashed their heads together as they stood outside the rose and crown.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically mentions \"the rose and crown on newgate street,\" which suggests that the location where the heads were smashed together was outside the Rose and Crown pub on Newgate Street. Summary A accurately reflects this detail, while Summary B omits the specific location and only mentions \"the rose,\" which is not consistent with the information provided in the article sentence.","258":" The correct answer is A: the american hunt is a chase - the intent is not to kill.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the American hunt is a chase, and that the intent is not to kill a fox. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by using the same language as the article and including the important detail that the intent is not to kill.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the word \"kill\" and ends the sentence with a incomplete phrase \"the intent is not to\". This summary does not accurately convey the information from the article and could potentially be misleading. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary with the article.","259":" The correct answer is A: seven games involving nimes were investigated after conrad was arrested.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically states that the games were investigated after Conrad was arrested, not after he was investigated. Summary A accurately reflects this information, while Summary B implies that the investigation of the games was a result of Conrad being investigated, which is not supported by the article. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","260":" The correct answer is A: knox, 27, broke down as she addressed the press following italy's supreme court ruling.\n\nExplanation: Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it includes all the information provided in the article sentence. It mentions Knox's age, the fact that she broke down in tears, and the fact that she addressed the press following Italy's supreme court ruling.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B omits the name of Knox's mother, Edda Mellas, and Mr. Sutherland, who were also present when Knox addressed the press. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not include all the information provided in the article sentence.","261":" The correct answer is (A) a man was arrested outside a bar in austin, texas.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it only states that a man was arrested outside a bar in Austin, Texas, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, adds the detail that the man was arrested after being arrested, which is not supported by the article. The article only states that the man was handcuffed and made to lie on the floor, but it does not mention anything about him being arrested again. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article and should not be chosen.","262":" The correct answer is A: attack on u.s. compound in benghazi, show her aides.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions \"compound in benghazi, libya\" and \"show her aides.\" Summary A accurately reflects these details by using the phrase \"attack on u.s. compound in benghazi\" and including the detail about showing aides. Summary B, on the other hand, omits the word \"u.s.\" and combines the two clauses of the article sentence into one sentence, which makes it less clear and less consistent with the original sentence. Therefore, Summary A is a better summary of the article sentence.","263":" The correct answer is (A) stuart lancaster's fourth year in charge they are yet to win.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that in Stuart Lancaster's fourth year in charge, they (the team) have not won the competition yet.

On the other hand, Summary B incorrectly states that they will win the competition, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","264":" The correct answer is A: judge ordered her to stay away from her child, she seemed only happy.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the sentence. The article sentence states that the judge ordered the person to stay away from her child, and that she seemed happy to oblige. Summary A includes both of these pieces of information, whereas Summary B only includes the first part of the sentence and omits the second part about her seeming happy. Therefore, Summary A is the better summary of the article sentence.","265":" The correct answer is A: mr boon felt moved to charity in memory of his recently deceased friends.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the sentence. The article sentence states that Mr. Boon felt moved to raise money for charity in memory of his recently deceased friends. Summary A omits the word \"raise\" which is not essential to the meaning of the sentence and still conveys the idea that Mr. Boon was motivated to give to charity in memory of his friends.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B, \"mr boon felt the money for charity in memory of his recently deceased friends,\" is not consistent with the article sentence. The sentence \"felt the money\" is not supported by the article, and it changes the meaning of the sentence entirely.","266":" The correct answer is (A) knox, 27, broke down in tears as she addressed the press.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Amanda Knox, who is 27 years old, broke down in tears as she addressed the press.

The article does not mention Curt Knox, Amanda Knox's father, breaking down in tears, nor does it mention him being present at the press conference. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","267":" The correct answer is A: knox, 27, broke down as she addressed the press following italy's supreme court ruling.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article states that Knox \"broke down in tears as she addressed the press following Italy's supreme court's ruling,\" which is correctly summarized in Summary A.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence. While it is true that Knox broke down in tears, the article does not mention that she did so \"after\" the supreme court's ruling. Instead, the article states that she broke down \"as she addressed the press following\" the ruling. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","268":" A","269":" The correct answer is A: it was in march 1965 that his first hit, it's not unusual.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by including all the information provided. It mentions the month and year when the singer's first hit went to number 1 in the UK, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the information about the song's popularity and fame, which is a significant aspect of the article sentence.

Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it correctly mentions the character's name and the show she appears on. Summary B, on the other hand, incorrectly refers to Uzo Aduba as \"crazy eyes warren\" and does not mention the show Orange is the New Black.","271":" The correct answer is A: gomis struck three minutes from time at villa park.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it only states that Gomis struck three minutes from time at Villa Park, which is a fact that is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, adds additional information that Gomis scored his second match since collapsing at Villa Park, which is not supported by the article sentence.

Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","272":" The correct answer is A: the bbc four documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that the documentary premiered in the U.K. (BBC Four), but it does not mention the U.S. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article as it includes information about the documentary being shown in the U.S., which is not supported by the article. Summary A, on the other hand, only mentions the documentary and its topic, which is consistent with the information provided in the article.","273":" The correct answer is (A) insiders say the row brought tensions between the starkly contrasting pair.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that insiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair to a head. The summary does not mention anything about Miliband's ear, which is not mentioned in the article sentence either.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions Miliband's ear, which is not present in the original sentence. Additionally, the phrase \"to a head\" is also missing in Summary B, which is an important part of the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the two.","274":" A","275":" The correct answer is A.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is consistent with the article sentence as it accurately states that Stuart Pearce was in charge of England under-21s for six years. This information is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions Phil Neville being tipped to replace Roy Hodgson, which is not related to the information provided in the article sentence.","276":" The correct answer is (B) ayesha bhatti, 29, says she was shocked to open a bag of favourite crisps.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A omits the detail about the contents of the bag, which is a crucial aspect of the article sentence. The article sentence specifically mentions that the bag contained the world's smallest wotsits, which is a significant detail that should be included in a summary.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by including the detail about the contents of the bag. It uses slightly different wording, but the meaning is the same, and all the information in the summary is supported by the article. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","277":" The correct answer is A: mollie has already curated two edits for high street brand.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Mollie has already curated two edits for the high street brand, and this information is accurately reflected in Summary A.

The article states that the 26-year-old began training his canine prodigy when the staffie was 14 weeks old, and Summary A correctly repeats this information.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the word \"weeks\" and says that the 26-year-old began training his canine prodigy when the staffie was 14, which could be interpreted as meaning 14 years old, rather than 14 weeks old. This is not consistent with the information provided in the article, and could potentially be misleading. Therefore, Summary A is the better choice.","281":" The correct answer is A: the mls outfit have released a snippet video for their track 'all the way'.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the outfit has released a \"snippet\" of the music video, which implies that the video is not a full-length video, but rather a short preview or teaser. Summary A accurately reflects this detail by using the phrase \"snippet video\", whereas Summary B incorrectly implies that a full-length music video has been released.","282":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it includes all the information provided in the article sentence. It mentions the man attacking with a machete and wasp spray, and also mentions the bag of molotov cocktails and the car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, only mentions the man attacking with a machete and a car containing smoke bombs, and omits the information about the wasp spray and the bag of molotov cocktails. Therefore, Summary B is a more accurate and complete summary of the article sentence.","283":" The correct answer is A: kai hibbard worked on her book 'too fat, too thin, can't win'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Kai Hibbard worked on a book called \"too fat, too thin, can't win\" with Deborah Baer, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nSummary A accurately reflects this information by mentioning the full title of the book and the fact that Kai Hibbard worked on it.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, only mentions that Kai Hibbard worked on a book called \"too fat\" with Deborah Baer, which is not entirely accurate since the full title of the book is \"too fat, too thin, can't win\".\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","284":" The correct answer is (A) the lion died while it was being transported.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that the lion died while it was being transported, and Summary A accurately reflects this information. Summary B, on the other hand, adds additional information that the lion was being transported to hospital, which is not supported by the article sentence.

It suggests that Moores is a county championship, which is not supported by the article. The article mentions Moores as a county championship winner, but it does not refer to him as a county championship. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","301":" The correct answer is A.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the content of the sentence. The sentence states that Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break, but was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. Summary A focuses on Ancelotti's concern about his players' relaxation, which is a key point in the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it suggests that Ancelotti's side were beaten by Levante, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence states that Ancelotti's side won the match 2-0, not that they were beaten. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","302":" The correct answer is A: the bbc four documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in delhi premiered.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically mentions that the documentary premiered in the U.K. (BBC Four), and that it is about the 2012 gang rape in Delhi, India.

Therefore, Summary B is not a factual summary of the article sentence.","308":" The correct answer is (A) however much they deny it, men do seem to care.\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the phrasing and meaning of the original sentence. The use of \"however much\" and the phrase \"do seem to care\" in both the article sentence and Summary A ensures that the summary accurately represents the information in the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B alters the phrasing and meaning of the original sentence by omitting the word \"much\" and changing the word order. This creates a summary that is not entirely consistent with the information in the article, and could potentially mislead the reader. Therefore, Summary A is the better choice.","309":" The correct answer is (A) the 45-year-old replaced alex mcleish at the premier league in june 2012.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately states that the 45-year-old replaced Alex McLeish at the Premier League club in June 2012.

This information is supported by the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. The article sentence does not mention Scotland at all, let alone Scotland beating Scotland in the first round of the match. Therefore, this summary is not supported by the article and is incorrect.","318":" The correct answer is A: the 45-year-old replaced alex mcleish at the helm of premier league club.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the information provided in the article.

Summary A correctly states that the 45-year-old replaced Alex McLeish at the helm of a Premier League club, which is supported by the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that the 45-year-old is still the current manager of the Premier League club, which is not supported by the article. The article states that the club parted company with the 45-year-old and later appointed Tim Sherwood as his successor, indicating that the 45-year-old is no longer the manager of the club. Therefore, Summary B is not accurate and cannot be considered consistent with the article.","319":" A","320":" The correct answer is A: a man arrested outside a bar in austin, texas, on the floor.\n\nThe article sentence specifically states that the man was made to lie on the floor after being handcuffed, which aligns with Summary A.

The article sentence states that Aubrey said her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old. Summary A correctly reports this information, using the same words and meaning as the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. It incorrectly states that Aubrey said she was eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old, which is not what the article sentence says. The article sentence does not mention Aubrey's eligibility for a wheelchair, only her son's eligibility. Therefore, Summary B is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","325":" The correct answer is (B) the news that jean had died in asuncion, paraguay.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions a \"cryptic reference to the news\" which implies that the information about Jean's death was not explicitly stated, but rather hinted at or suggested. Therefore, Summary B, which mentions \"the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay\" is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the indirect nature of the information presented in the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A, which simply states \"Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay\" presents the information as a fact, without acknowledging the cryptic nature of the reference, which is not entirely accurate.","326":" The correct answer is A: the chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by using the exact phrase \"thousands of chickens\" and correctly stating that they live together in huge sheds for 35 days before being gassed.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the word \"chickens\" and uses the phrase \"the thousands\" instead, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence specifically refers to \"thousands of chickens,\" not just \"thousands\" of unspecified animals. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","327":" The correct answer is (A) britain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it only states that major engineering projects are expected to be launched on Britain's busiest rail routes, which is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, adds additional information that passengers will face travel chaos, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article sentence. While it is possible that passengers may face disruptions due to the engineering projects, the article sentence does not confirm this, and therefore, Summary B is not as consistent with the article sentence as Summary A.","328":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A states that the highest selection will be forfeited \"if the game,\" which implies that the forfeiture of the highest selection is a result of the game itself, rather than a specific condition related to the falcons' picks. This is not consistent with the article sentence, which states that the highest selection will be forfeited if the falcons have multiple picks in that round.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B accurately summarizes the article sentence by stating that the highest selection will be forfeited if the falcons have multiple picks in that round. This is consistent with the article sentence, as it correctly states the condition under which the highest selection will be forfeited.","329":" The correct answer is A: admitted to having treatment for sex addiction and ulrika jonsson.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Russell Brand has admitted to getting treatment for sex addiction, and that Ulrika Jonsson presented a show called \"Am I a Sex Addict?\" in which she questioned her own romantic behavior.\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the information in the article sentence, using the same words and phrasing as the original sentence. It correctly states that Brand admitted to having treatment for sex addiction and that Jonsson presented a show about sex addiction.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B contains an error. It incorrectly states that Jonsson's name is \"jonsson jonsson,\" which is not a correct or consistent way to refer to her. This summary is not consistent with the article sentence, as it introduces a new name that is not mentioned in the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.","330":" The correct answer is (B) it's a typical day -- cold and damp, with sky as old army boots.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A omits the word \"grey\" before \"sky,\" which is present in the original sentence. Additionally, \"as old army boots\" modifies \"sky\" in the original sentence, but in Summary A, it modifies \"a typical day.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B accurately retains the word \"grey\" and the correct modification of \"as old army boots\" to \"sky.\" Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","331":" The correct answer is (A) seven games were investigated after conrad was arrested last november.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the information provided in the article sentence. It correctly states that seven games were investigated after Conrad's arrest, which is consistent with the information in the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article. It states that seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about Nimes being arrested, only that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad's arrest. Therefore, Summary B is not a factual summary of the article.","332":" The correct answer is A: \"couple never lived together but would see each other times a week.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. The article states that the couple never lived together, but would see each other several times a week, and the woman had keys to the man's property. Summary A correctly captures this information, while Summary B only mentions that the couple never lived together, but does not mention the additional detail about the frequency of their meetings or the woman's access to the man's property. Therefore, Summary A is a more comprehensive and accurate summary of the article sentence.","333":" A. The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that the current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Summary A accurately summarizes this statement by focusing on the fact that the current generation is confused about sex, which is supported by the article. Summary B, on the other hand, focuses on pornography, which is mentioned in the article as the cause of confusion, but it is not the main point of the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","334":" The correct answer is A: migrants who come to britain to live or work must prove they have not committed crime.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years, which means they must show that they have a clean criminal record for the past ten years. Summary A accurately reflects this requirement, while Summary B is incorrect because it suggests that migrants must prove they have committed a crime, which is the opposite of what the article states.","335":" The correct answer is A: mollie has curated two edits for the high street brand.\n\nExplanation:\nSummary A is consistent with the article sentence as it accurately states that Mollie has curated two edits for the high street brand. The use of the word \"already\" in the article sentence implies that Mollie has previously curated two edits, which is correctly reflected in Summary A.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that Mollie has been curated by the high street brand, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence only mentions that Mollie has curated two edits for the high street brand, not that she has been curated by the brand. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","336":" The correct answer is A: spirit airlines has new fare deal with sex jokes.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Spirit Airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by mentioning both the new fare deal and the use of sex jokes in the announcement.

Summary A maintains this tense consistency by using the past tense \"was\" and accurately reflecting the information provided in the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B uses the present tense \"is one of them,\" which implies that Jean Bourdain is still a member of the group. However, the article sentence does not provide any information to suggest that Jean Bourdain is still alive or still a member of the group, so Summary B is not consistent with the article.","339":" The correct answer is A: lewis hamilton claimed his first victory for ferrari.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Lewis Hamilton sat on the podium alongside Sebastian Vettel after he claimed his first victory for Ferrari. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by stating that Lewis Hamilton claimed his first victory for Ferrari.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it suggests that Lewis Hamilton claimed his first victory for his Ferrari, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about Lewis Hamilton's ownership of a Ferrari. Therefore, Summary A is the better summary of the article sentence.","340":" The correct answer is (B) Roma and Tottenham have asked to be kept informed.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that there is interest from Roma, and that Tottenham and Everton have asked to be kept informed. Summary B accurately reflects this information, mentioning both Roma and Tottenham as teams that have asked to be kept informed. Summary A, on the other hand, only mentions Tottenham and Everton, leaving out the information about Roma's interest.

Summary A accurately summarizes this statement by stating that the current generation is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, changes the focus of the statement from sex to pornography, which is not entirely consistent with the article sentence. While pornography is mentioned in the article sentence, it is not the main focus of the statement. Therefore, Summary B is not as consistent with the article sentence as Summary A.","342":" The correct answer is (B) rima karaki was conducting an interview with london-based islamist al-seba al-seba.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not mention that Hani al-Seba'i is based in London, which is a crucial detail provided in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani al-Seba'i. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","343":" The correct answer is A: coach peter moores talks to the media during a press conference.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it only includes information that is supported by the article. The article sentence mentions that Peter Moores, the England coach, talked to the media during a press conference, and this is accurately reflected in Summary A.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B includes additional information that is not supported by the article sentence, specifically that Peter Moores talked to the Adelaide Oval on Sunday. The article sentence does not mention the Adelaide Oval, nor does it specify the day of the week when the press conference took place. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence.","344":" The correct answer is A: the home was built for former prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the home was built for Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie, which is consistent with Summary A.

The article states that Palermo president Mauro Zamparini values the 21-year-old player at #30 million. Summary A correctly reports this information by stating that the player is valued at #30 million by Mauro Zamparini.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. It states that the player is valued at #30 million for Palermo president Mauro Zamparini, which implies that the value is for Zamparini's personal benefit or possession, rather than being his evaluation of the player's worth. The article does not suggest that Zamparini owns the player or has any personal financial interest in their value. Therefore, Summary B is not supported by the information in the article.","346":" The correct answer is A.\n\nSummary A is consistent with the article sentence as it only states that Tony Blair will attend a service honoring soldiers killed in Afghanistan, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, implies that Tony Blair killed the soldiers in Afghanistan, which is not supported by the article and is therefore inconsistent with it.","347":" The correct answer is A: they were shocked when they found over 1000 pairs of runners and slippers stashed away.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically mentions that the man had over 1000 pairs of runners and slippers stashed away, so Summary A is more consistent with the article as it includes both types of footwear. Summary B only mentions runners, which is not consistent with the article's mention of both runners and slippers.","348":" The correct answer is (A) louis van gaal says he believed wenger's estimation of the points total.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Louis van Gaal said he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total. Summary A accurately reflects this by using the phrase \"he believed\" to indicate that Van Gaal is expressing his own opinion, and by including the phrase \"Wenger's estimation\" to indicate that the estimation in question is Wenger's.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, changes the wording to \"wenger's estimation of the necessary points total,\" which could be interpreted as a statement of fact rather than an expression of Van Gaal's belief. This could be seen as inconsistent with the article sentence, which only states that Van Gaal believed Wenger's estimation, without explicitly stating what that estimation was. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","349":" The correct answer is (A) andy murray has insisted it was all a joke.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Andy Murray claimed he had a \"little girlfriend in Glasgow\" and that he has insisted it was all a joke. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by stating that Andy Murray has insisted it was all a joke, without specifying a location. Since the article does not mention the location where Andy Murray made the joke, Summary A is more consistent with the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B specifies that Andy Murray made the joke in Glasgow, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that Andy Murray claimed he had a \"little girlfriend in Glasgow,\" but it does not specify where he made the joke. Therefore, Summary B is less consistent with the article and is not the best summary.","350":" The correct answer is A: british no 1 went down 6-2, 6-3 in 88 minutes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it includes all the information provided in the article sentence.

This information is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence.

Summary A correctly paraphrases this information by stating that sex addiction is also described by Relate.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. While it mentions the concept of sexual activity feeling out of control, it does not accurately convey the idea that Relate describes sex addiction as such.
