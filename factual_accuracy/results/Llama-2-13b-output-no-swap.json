{"output":{"0":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the abc have reported that those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year. Therefore, the summary should be a direct representation of that information, which is: \"those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year.\" Summary B is not as consistent because it adds the phrase \"the abc have reported\" which is not directly supported by the article sentence.","1":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two champions league places.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"scramble\" and \"could prove more tense and exciting\" which suggests a competitive struggle for the two Champions League places. Summary A accurately captures this idea by using the word \"scramble\". In contrast, Summary B uses the word \"bid\", which does not convey the same level of intensity and competition. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","2":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the 25 year old from pennsylvania went on a level with the likes of beyonce or adele.\n\nThe article sentence states that the 25 year old from pennsylvania became a global superstar on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele, indicating that the individual achieved a high level of success and recognition similar to that of these well-known celebrities. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that the individual went on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that the 25 year old went viral, which is not entirely accurate based on the information provided in the article sentence. While the individual may have gained popularity and recognition, the article does not suggest that they became viral in the sense of spreading widely and rapidly across the internet. Therefore, Summary B is less consistent with the article sentence.","3":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: seven games involving nimes were investigated after conrad was arrested.\n\nExplanation: The sentence \"seven games involving nimes were investigated after conrad was arrested last november\" contains all the necessary information to support the summary. The word \"last\" is not essential to the summary, as it is already implied by the fact that the investigation took place after Conrad's arrest. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","4":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that the driver's side of the windscreen \"immediately shatters and falls through.\"\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that the driver's side of the windscreen \"immediately shatters and falls.\"\n* Summary B is not as consistent with the article sentence, as it adds the word \"were\" and changes the phrasing to \"immediately shatters and falls through.\" This wording is not supported by the article sentence.","5":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: shafqat hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged thursday.\n\nThe article states that Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed on Wednesday night that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. This information is not present in Summary B, which only mentions that Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article.","6":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won the departmental elections.\n\nThe article sentence states that Mr. Sarkozy referred to the ump's electoral alliance with the Centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) and mentioned that never in the history of the fifth republic has their political family won so many departments. This implies that the electoral alliance has won the departmental elections, which is consistent with Summary A.","7":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: ** k' can also be included in messages.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that \"terrorist\" and \"d ** k\" can also be included in messages, but it does not mention \"k''\". Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it only includes \"** k'\", which is supported by the article.","8":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: insiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair.\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"starkly contrasting pair\" and \"tensions between,\" which are both present in Summary A. Summary B omits the phrase \"starkly contrasting\" and instead mentions \"miliband's ear,\" which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","9":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: katarzyne pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a thai transvestite jealous over her husband.\n\nAll information in this summary is supported by the article, including the name of the victim, her age, the weapon used in the attack, and the motivation of the attacker.\n\nSummary B does not accurately convey all of the information in the article sentence, as there is no mention of a court in the sentence. Therefore, Summary B is not as consistent with the article as Summary A.","10":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the man, named only as saleh, said the masked militant appears in several beheading videos.\n\nThis is because the article sentence states that the man (Saleh) said the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, but it does not mention that Saleh appears in the videos himself. Therefore, Summary A is a more accurate representation of the information in the article sentence.","11":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the boxer will instead meet manny pacquaio in a $ 300million mega-fight.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the bolton boxer had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather, but instead, he will meet Manny Pacquiao in a $300 million mega-fight. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that the boxer will meet Pacquiao in a $300 million mega-fight, without mentioning Mayweather.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, incorrectly states that the bolton boxer had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather in a $300 million mega-fight. This information is not supported by the article sentence, which states that the boxer had hoped to take on Mayweather but will instead meet Pacquiao.","12":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the home was built for former australian prime minister malcolm fraser.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article sentence, which states that the home was built for Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie. The article does not mention anything about the home being opened for inspection, so this information is not supported by the article and should not be included in a summary of the article.","13":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA) he was unable to use his hands and lying next to several police officers.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article sentence, which states that the man was unable to use his hands and was lying next to several police officers. The other summary, B, does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence as it implies that the man was able to use his hands, which is not stated in the article sentence.","14":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the man who attacked a security area at the new orleans airport with a machete and a car containing smoke bombs.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries mention the man attacking with a machete, but only Summary B mentions the car containing smoke bombs, which is also mentioned in the article. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","15":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nA. roberto mancini has turned up the heat on manuel pellegrini's successor.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Roberto Mancini has claimed that Manuel Pellegrini's successor should be winning a trophy every year. This implies that Mancini is addressing Pellegrini's successor, rather than Pellegrini himself. Therefore, summary A is a more accurate reflection of the article's content.","16":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds.\n\nThis summary accurately captures the essence of the article sentence, which states that critics believe the measures do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut down hundreds of branches, even if there is no other bank in the community.","17":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: a prized silver dollar each could fetch $ 10 or more.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states \"and a prized silver dollar each could fetch $ 10 million or more.\" This implies that the value of each silver dollar could be more than $10 million, but does not specify an exact amount. Therefore, Summary B's phrasing of \"could fetch $ 10 or more\" is more consistent with the article's information.","18":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the toffees were the country's last hope on thursday night.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article mentions that the Toffees were the country's last hope on the continent before their 5-2 loss to Dynamo Kiev.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that the Toffees were the country's last hope on Thursday night.\n* Summary B does not accurately capture this information as it only mentions the team's performance in the last 16 stage, without specifying the date or the country's hope.","19":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. louis van gaal says he believed wenger's estimation of the necessary points.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Louis van Gaal believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total. Summary A accurately conveys this information by saying that van Gaal believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that van Gaal says Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total, which is not entirely accurate as the article only mentions van Gaal's belief in Wenger's estimation, not the actual total.","20":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: visitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on friday.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that visitors will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday for the solar eclipse, so the summary should reflect that specific detail. Summary B does not accurately convey that information and is therefore less consistent with the article.","21":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: they claim customers are being driven away by the noises.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that customers are being driven away by the noises, which starts around lunchtime.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that customers are being driven away by the noises.\n* Summary B does not accurately capture the information as it states \"they claim they are being driven away by the noises\" which is not supported by the article sentence.","22":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: captured at 1,500 frames per second.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the video was captured at 1,500 frames per second, which is a factual statement about the video. Summary A accurately reflects this fact by simply stating that the video was captured at 1,500 frames per second, without adding any additional information or modifying the original phrase.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that the video was captured by 1,500 frames per second, which is a slightly different phrasing that could be interpreted as suggesting that the video was captured using 1,500 frames per second as a tool or device, rather than simply being captured at that speed. This subtle difference in phrasing makes Summary B less consistent with the article sentence.","23":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: she said freya's friends have been allocated places at a school in beaconsfield.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article sentence, which states that Mrs. Jarvis said most of Freya's friends have been allocated places at a school in the town of Beaconsfield.","24":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"for the first time in a while\" which implies that the team's strike runners consistently found clean air to run in, despite missing chances against Scotland.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by mentioning \"despite missing chances\" and \"consistently found clean air to run in\".\n* Summary B is not consistent with the article as it mentions \"for the first time in a year\", which is not mentioned in the article sentence.","25":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: but now conditions on the farms can be shown for the first time.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"the farms that supply kfc with 23million chickens a year,\" which implies that the conditions on these farms can be shown for the first time. Summary A accurately captures this information by focusing on the conditions of the farms rather than the number of chickens supplied to KFC.","26":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: she always radiates with a natural beauty, but cate is looking her best.\n\nExplanation: The article states that Cate Blanchett \"always radiates with a natural beauty,\" but it also mentions that she relies on some beauty secrets to keep her looking her best. This suggests that while she does not use surgical or needle-based methods to enhance her appearance, she does use other beauty techniques to maintain her look. Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that she always radiates with a natural beauty, but does not specifically mention the use of needles or surgery.","27":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the most consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: she and her husband were trying to walk away.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"her husband\" which indicates that the subject is a female and her spouse is male, therefore Summary A is the most accurate and consistent summary. Summary B is not consistent as it refers to the subject's spouse as \"her wife\" which is not supported by the article sentence.","28":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: brianne altice, 35-year-old brianne, has been charged with rape, sodomy and sex abuse.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that Brianne Altice, a 35-year-old former teacher, has been charged with 14 felonies, including rape, sodomy, and sex abuse, for allegedly having sexual relationships with three different students.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by listing the charges as rape, sodomy, and sex abuse, without any inconsistencies or inaccuracies.\n* Summary B, on the other hand, lists the age of Brianne Altice as 21, which is not supported by the article sentence. Additionally, it only lists three charges (rape, sodomy, and sex abuse), while the article sentence mentions 14 felonies.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","29":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: fans displayed the messages on bloomfield road ahead of their 3-0 defeat.\n\nThe article states that the fans displayed the messages ahead of their 3-0 defeat by Charlton Athletic, so Summary A accurately reflects the information in the article. Summary B is not consistent with the article as it states the fans displayed the messages ahead of their 3-0 win, which is not supported by the information in the article.","30":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: the three and four-year-old boys were snapping at their pyjama elastic.\n\nThis is because the article sentence specifically mentions \"all the three and four-year-old boys\" and \"their pyjama elastic,\" which is accurately captured in Summary A. Summary B omits the phrase \"all the three and four-year-old boys\" and only mentions \"the three and boys,\" which is not as precise and factual as Summary A.","31":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: ** k' can also be included in messages.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that \"terrorist\" and \"d ** k\" can also be included in messages, and Summary A is the only one that includes both of these elements. Additionally, Summary A is more concise and precise by only including the key information from the article sentence.","32":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary with the article sentence is:\n\nSummary A: coach mike catt wants england to be more ruthless.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"scoring points,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in Summary B.\n* Summary A accurately captures the essence of the article sentence by emphasizing Coach Mike Catt's desire for England to be more ruthless in their approach to scoring points.\n* In contrast, Summary B only partially captures the idea of the article sentence, as it omits the aspect of scoring points.","33":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: gomis struck three minutes from time at villa park.\n\nThe article sentence states that Gomis scored three minutes from time at Villa Park, which is supported by the information in Summary A. Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it states that Gomis scored three goals, which is not mentioned in the article.","34":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. the luggage you like in the boot and head to the coast, drive aboard the ferry.\n\nThis summary accurately captures the information in the article sentence, which mentions loading all the luggage you like in the boot and driving aboard the ferry, but does not mention starting the holiday in the boot or heading to the coast.","35":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: herrera also revealed that rooney is the joker inside united's dressing room.\n\nThis is because the article sentence mentions that Rooney is the joker inside the dressing room, but not that he has to keep the conversation away from boxing. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it only includes information that is supported by the article.","36":" Based on the article sentence \"to this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded,\" the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. The fame is untainted and the talent uneroded.\n\nExplanation: Both sentences accurately convey the information from the article sentence, but Summary B adds the phrase \"this day\" which is not present in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","37":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: prince of wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as 'a unique moment'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"a unique moment in anyone's life\", but the phrase \"in anyone's life\" is not explicitly stated in the sentence. Therefore, Summary A, which omits the phrase \"in anyone's life\", is more consistent with the article sentence.","38":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the club has managed to preserve a pastime that requires vast open space.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries contain information from the article sentence, but only Summary A accurately conveys all the information. Summary B emphasizes the size of the land protected, but neglects to mention the requirement for vast open space. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","39":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: stuart lancaster's side are yet to win this competition.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that in Stuart Lancaster's fourth year in charge, they are yet to win this competition, which means that the team has not won the competition yet. Summary A accurately reflects this information by saying that the team is yet to win the competition. Summary B, on the other hand, states that they will win the competition, which is not supported by the article sentence.","40":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: moores, a county championship winner, finds himself under increasing pressure.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article mentions that Moores is a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire.\n* The summary should include this information to ensure consistency with the article.\n* Summary B does not include this information and is therefore less consistent with the article.","41":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: he filmed using a specially designed set-up part of the aspergillus genus.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the moulds were filmed using a specially designed set-up, and that part of the moulds belonged to the aspergillus genus. Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that he filmed using a specially designed set-up part of the aspergillus genus.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the aspergillus genus. This wording is slightly different from the article sentence and does not accurately capture the information that only part of the moulds belonged to the aspergillus genus.","42":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. the easter bunny was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the Easter bunny was invented in German folklore to determine whether children had been well-behaved. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that the Easter bunny was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved. Summary B, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence as it states that children had been well-behaved, which is not supported by the article.","43":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: scotland international made an # 11million move from leeds in the summer.\n\nThe article states that the Scotland international made an #11million move from Leeds in the summer, but the move has backfired with Fulham falling perilously close to the relegation places in recent weeks. There is no mention of the Scotland international making an #11million move from Fulham in the article. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","44":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: moores, a county championship winner with both sussex and lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after england's woeful showing at this world cup.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A includes all the information mentioned in the article sentence, whereas Summary B omits the information about Moores being a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","45":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: he filmed using a specially designed set-up part of the aspergillus genus.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"part of the aspergillus genus\" which is consistent with Summary A's \"part of the aspergillus genus\".\n* Summary B's \"was part of the genus\" is not consistent with the article sentence as the article does not mention \"genus\" but rather \"aspergillus genus\".","46":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: mike catt wants england more ruthless when it comes to scoring points.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"scoring points,\" which is explicitly included in Summary A.\n* Summary B omits the phrase \"scoring points,\" which is not consistent with the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","47":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. He was also ordered to pay $167 million in restitution and fines.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"restitution and fines,\" so the correct summary should include both words. Summary B omits the word \"restitution\" and only includes \"damages,\" which is not supported by the article sentence.","48":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"for the first time in a while\" which indicates that the team's strike runners consistently found clean air to run in, despite missing chances.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by stating \"despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\"\n* Summary B does not accurately capture this information as it states \"for first time in a row\" which is not supported by the article sentence.","49":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. lee, 91, is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information provided in the article sentence, which states that Lee is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital. The article does not mention the location of the hospital, so it is not included in the summary.","50":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: aubrey said he would be eligible when he is five years old.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Aubrey was told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old, and Summary A accurately conveys that information by stating that Aubrey's son will be eligible when he is five years old, without adding any extra information or making any assumptions.","51":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: they made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the material was made by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film, so the summary should capture this detail. Summary A accurately conveys this information by mentioning that the features were etched smaller than a wavelength of light, without specifying the material they were etched onto. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","52":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: sebastian vettel is on the podium after sunday's malaysian grand prix.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Sebastian Vettel was on the podium after the Malaysian Grand Prix, and this information is supported by the summary. However, the summary B does not mention the podium, and therefore is not as consistent with the article sentence.","53":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the club has managed to protect a pastime that requires vast open space.\n\nThe article sentence states that the club has protected a patchwork of land that is larger than Manhattan, but the focus of the sentence is on the fact that the land is vast and open, rather than its size compared to Manhattan. Summary A accurately captures this aspect of the article sentence.","54":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the russian poet says it's better to die from vodka than from boredom.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"a quote, a motto, from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky\" which suggests that the quote is attributed to the poet himself. Therefore, using \"the Russian poet says\" in the summary is more appropriate than using \"the Russian says\" as it accurately reflects the source of the quote. Additionally, using \"says\" instead of \"say\" in the summary is also more appropriate because the quote is attributed to a single person, rather than multiple people.","55":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: coach peter moores talks to media during a press conference.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday,\" which suggests that the coach's talk was specifically related to a media event held at the Adelaide Oval on a Sunday. Summary A accurately captures this information by mentioning \"coach Peter Moores talks to media during a press conference.\" In contrast, Summary B does not mention the specific location or the fact that it was a press conference, which makes it less consistent with the article sentence.","56":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: sam livesey, 18, was captured by sportsmail appearing to strike oldham's unsuspecting jack tuohy.\n\nThis summary accurately conveys the information in the article sentence, which states that Sam Livesey was captured on a clip obtained by Sportsmail appearing to strike Oldham's unsuspecting Jack Tuohy in the temple. The summary includes all the relevant information from the article sentence and does not omit or add any information that is not supported by the article.","57":" Based on the article sentence \"he claims he knew he was a boy when he was two,\" the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: he claims that he was a boy when he was two.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence explicitly states that the person claimed to have known they were a boy at the age of two, without any qualifiers or additional information. Therefore, Summary A is the most accurate and consistent summary of the article sentence.","58":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: lucy powell, 40, became embroiled in a dispute over powell's brit awards plans.\n\nThis summary accurately captures the information in the article sentence, which states that Lucy Powell, who is 40 years old, became embroiled in a dispute over her Brit Awards plans. The other summary, B, does not accurately capture the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions \"ms powell's brit\" without specifying what the dispute was over.","59":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to pummel her.\n\nExplanation: Both Summary A and Summary B contain all the information from the article sentence, but Summary A is more precise and factual as it includes the detail that the man \"pummels\" the young girl, which is a more specific and accurate word choice than \"begins with\" in Summary B.","60":" Based on the article sentence you provided, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: clinton said the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.\n\nThe wording of Summary B is a more precise representation of the article sentence, as it includes the phrase \"vast majority\" which is present in the original sentence. Summary A omits this phrase and instead uses the phrase \"majority\" which may not accurately convey the extent to which Clinton's work emails were sent to government employees.","61":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Both summaries capture the main idea of the article sentence, which is that passengers will face travel chaos this Easter due to major engineering projects on Britain's busiest rail routes.\n* However, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it includes the specific information that the engineering projects are expected to take place, which is not included in Summary B. This adds more detail and supports the main idea of the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.","62":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: aubrey said she was told he was eligible when he is five years old.\n\nThe article sentence states that Aubrey was told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old, which is a specific and concrete piece of information. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that Aubrey was told she was eligible when he is five years old.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that Aubrey would be eligible when he is five years old, which is a more general and uncertain statement. It does not accurately reflect the specific information provided in the article sentence.","63":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: atlanta falcons have been fined # 237,000 for use of fake crowd noise.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence explicitly states that the Atlanta Falcons were fined $237,000 for their use of fake crowd noise at the Georgia Dome. Both summaries mention the use of fake crowd noise, but only Summary A includes the specific information that the fine was for the use of fake crowd noise. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","64":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. Pearce has been in charge of England Under-21s for six years.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Pearce was the manager of England Under-21s for six years, but does not mention anything about Neville replacing Hodgson. Therefore, Summary B is not supported by the article.","65":" Based on the information provided, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The article sentence states that the world cup winner turned skills coach said \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good.\"\n* Summary A accurately conveys this information by stating \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\" without adding any additional information or changing the wording of the original sentence.\n* Summary B, on the other hand, adds the phrase \"the world cup winner has been\" before \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\" which is not present in the original sentence. This addition is not supported by the article and could be considered an error.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","66":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: but now conditions on the farms that supply kfc with 23million chickens a year can be shown.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries capture the main idea of the article sentence, which is that the conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23 million chickens a year can be shown for the first time. However, summary B omits the phrase \"but now,\" which is present in the article sentence. This phrase emphasizes that the conditions can be shown for the first time, which is an important detail that should not be left out. Therefore, summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","67":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role.\n\nThe article sentence states that Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young prince's life, and both words \"increasingly\" and \"peripheral\" are present in the summary.\n\nSummary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it includes the word \"increasingly\" twice, which is not present in the article sentence.","68":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the thousands of chickens live together in just 35 days before they are gassed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries mention the duration of the chickens' living together (35 days) and their ultimate fate (being gassed), but only Summary A accurately conveys that the chickens live together in just 35 days before being gassed, without mentioning the type of facility where they live.","69":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. passengers can take their own car and the journey is all part of the experience.\n\nBoth summaries capture the essence of the article sentence, but summary A is more comprehensive and precise by including the phrase \"all part of the experience.\"","70":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: beleaguered travellers warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that beleaguered travellers have been warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned, and many key services will be axed. Summary A accurately captures this information by focusing on the cancellation of Easter for trains, which is the main point of the article sentence. Summary B, on the other hand, focuses on the cancellation of key services for trains, which is not the main point of the article sentence.","71":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the fish was discovered in the gurupi river in north central brazil.\n\nThis is because the article sentence mentions the location of the discovery as \"north central Brazil,\" while Summary B only mentions \"north Brazil.\" The article provides more specific information about the location of the discovery, which is supported by the phrase \"in the gurupi river.\" Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","72":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: she was told to 'get and interpreter' by staff at port orange post office.\n\nThe wording of the article sentence is \"a deaf woman claims she was told to 'get and interpreter' by staff at port orange post office,\" which is a direct quote from the woman. The word \"told\" implies a more direct and forceful instruction, which is consistent with the language used in Summary A. In contrast, the wording of Summary B (\"asked to get an interpreter\") is more indirect and does not accurately reflect the language used in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary with the article.","73":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nAnswer: A (migrants who come to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime).\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years in order to be allowed to live or work in Britain. This implies that the absence of a criminal record is a requirement for migration, and therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","74":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: the russian poet says it is 'better to die from vodka than from boredom'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries convey the same message as the article sentence, but Summary A is a more precise and factual representation of the quote. It uses the exact words from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, as stated in the article sentence. In contrast, Summary B is a paraphrased version of the quote and does not use the exact words from the poet. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","75":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: ayew has netted six times for marseille this season.\n\nThe article sentence states that Ayew has netted six times for Marseille this season, and also scored three during the Africa Cup of Nations. Therefore, Summary A accurately captures all the information mentioned in the article sentence. Summary B only mentions that Ayew has netted six during the Africa Cup of Nations, which is not entirely accurate as the article also mentions that he netted six times for Marseille this season.","76":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: Alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Alonso has claimed that his steering wheel locked, which caused his pre-season testing crash in Barcelona. Therefore, Summary A accurately reflects the information in the article by specifying both the cause of the crash (steering wheel locking) and the location of the crash (pre-season testing in Barcelona). In contrast, Summary B omits the location of the crash and simply states that Alonso's steering wheel locked, which is not as specific or accurate as Summary A.","77":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: brittney ross brewer, from windham, maine, feared she wouldn't make it.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that Brittney feared she wouldn't make it till her February 27 nuptials.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that Brittney feared she wouldn't make it.\n* Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it incorrectly states that Brittney feared she wouldn't make it till her February. There is no mention of \"February\" in the article sentence.","78":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. the man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to pummel her.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that the man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to pummel her with a large stone.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that the man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to pummel her.\n* Summary B is incomplete and inaccurate because it only mentions the man forcing the ground, without specifying what he does with the young girl.","79":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: google dubbed the first set of several thousand glass users.\n\nThe article sentence states that Google dubbed the first set of several thousand glass users, and Summary A accurately reflects this information without adding any additional information or making any changes to the original sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, adds the word \"glass\" twice, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is not as consistent with the article as Summary A.","80":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: professor jonathan armbruster said his colleagues noticed resemblance to the alien killed by han solo.\n\nThe article mentions that Professor Jonathan Armbruster said his colleagues noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo, but does not mention the first Star Wars film. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article.","81":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: chelsea's izzy brown has been named in sean o'driscoll's european qualifiers.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"chelsea's izzy brown\" specifically, so it is more accurate to include the possessive pronoun \"chelsea's\" in the summary.\n* Summary B omits the possessive pronoun and simply states \"chelsea has been named,\" which is not as specific and could be interpreted as referring to the club as a whole rather than the individual player.","82":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: passengers can look at fish while staying dry and is small.\n\nThis is because the article mentions that the diminutive sub can dive to depths of up to 300ft (91 meters) and that it is small enough to be stowed on a yacht. These two points are both supported in the article, and they are both included in Summary A.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, only mentions that passengers can look at fish while staying on a yacht. This is not entirely accurate, as the article does not mention anything about passengers staying on a yacht. Therefore, Summary B is not as consistent with the article as Summary A.","83":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: the ex-chief of defence staff said he was'mystified' about why the police had searched his home in Surrey.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the content of the article sentence, which states that the ex-chief of defence staff was mystified about why the police had searched his home in Surrey. Summary B does not accurately reflect the content of the article sentence, as it only mentions the police and does not specify the reason for the search. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","84":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: kane is one of the most talked about players in the country.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"the country\" as the scope of discussion, and both summaries mention \"players\" and \"Kane,\" but only Summary A accurately reflects the scope of the article by including \"the country\" in the summary. Summary B is too specific and only mentions \"the rovers,\" which is not supported by the article sentence.","85":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. The American hunt is a chase - the intent is not to kill.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the sport's ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns 10 years ago is still debated, but does not mention a ban in America. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article.","86":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: victim, now 38, is one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that the victim was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic, which is consistent with Summary A.\n* Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it states that the victim was 29, which is not correct according to the article.","87":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: tina fey's follow-up to 30 rock is not all of it good.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that not all of the attention received by Tina Fey's follow-up to 30 Rock is good, which is supported by the phrase \"not all of it good\" in the summary. In contrast, Summary A only mentions that the follow-up is getting a lot of attention, which is partially supported by the article sentence but does not fully capture the nuance of the attention being both positive and negative.","88":" Based on the information provided, the more consistent summary with the article sentence would be:\n\nA. `ninety-nine per cent of things were very good,' said the world cup winner.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\" which implies that the speaker is referring to a large percentage of things being good.\n* Summary A accurately conveys this information by stating \"ninety-nine per cent of things were very good,\" which is a direct quote from the article sentence.\n* Summary B, on the other hand, misquotes the article sentence by stating \"the world cup winner has been ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\" which is not supported by the original sentence.","89":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax report.\n\nThe article sentence states that the government spokesman dismissed the report of Singapore's founding father's death as a hoax, which is supported by the wording of Summary A. Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it states the opposite of what the article says.","90":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. Ireland take on France in the evening kick-off on Saturday.\n\nExplanation: The article mentions that Ireland will attempt to rack up both the win and tries needed at BT Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon, which suggests that the Ireland vs. France match will take place on Saturday. Additionally, the article mentions that the match will be in the evening, which further supports the accuracy of summary A. Summary B is not consistent with the article as it states that Ireland will take on France in the evening kick-off on Sunday, which is not supported by the information in the article.","91":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: manchester united have also been to watch the argentine.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Manchester United have been to watch the Argentine, but he is not high on their list. This implies that they have been to observe or scout the Argentine player, but they are not particularly interested in signing him. Summary A accurately reflects this information by using the word \"watch\" instead of \"play\".","92":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nA. marcos lopes will be keen to stay with the ligue 1 club.\n\nThe article states that marcos lopes, who is on loan from Manchester City, would be keen to stay with the Ligue 1 club beyond the end of the season if he is not sure of regular playing time back at Manchester City. This implies that marcos lopes is the one who would be keen to stay, and not marcos rojo, who is not mentioned in the article. Therefore, summary A is the most consistent with the article.","93":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: he has spoken of personally meeting prime minister but leads a double life.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article sentence, which states that the person has spoken of meeting the prime minister but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes. Summary B does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions the prime minister's double life and does not include the information about the person's own double life.","94":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: samantha green, whose 20-day-old son, was found dead near the sacramento river in northern california.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that Samantha Green's 20-day-old son was found dead near the Sacramento River in northern California.\n* Summary A includes this information and correctly states that the son was found dead.\n* Summary B does not mention the son's death and instead states that Samantha Green, 23, was found dead near the Sacramento River.

This implies that Gary Neville needs to gain experience in management, which is consistent with Summary A.\n\nSummary B: stuart pearce believes gary neville needs to get managerial job, is not as consistent with the article sentence as it does not specify that Gary Neville needs to gain experience in management, and could be interpreted as simply requiring a job in management, which is not necessarily the same thing.","101":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: giorgio armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"the'skouser' - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material,\" which is the creation of Giorgio Armani.

Summary A accurately captures this information.\n\nSummary B does not accurately capture the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions being shot around the same time, without specifying that the collaboration has been removed from the runway.","103":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. the easter bunny was invented in german folklore, where an 'easter hare' was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved.\n\nExplanation: Both summaries include the information that the Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, but only Summary A accurately includes the detail that the Easter hare was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved, which is supported by the article sentence.","104":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: locke chats with ryan stevenson.\n\nThe article sentence only mentions \"last season,\" but does not mention \"last year.\" Therefore, Summary B is not entirely consistent with the article sentence, as it includes additional information that is not supported by the sentence.","105":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: his former teacher, brianne altice, has been charged with rape, sodomy and sex abuse.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that Brianne Altice, a 35-year-old former teacher, has been charged with 14 felonies, including rape, sodomy, and sex abuse, for allegedly having sexual relationships with three different students.\n* Summary A accurately reflects this information by listing the charges as rape, sodomy, and sex abuse, without any errors or omissions.\n* Summary B, on the other hand, incorrectly states that Brianne Altice is 21 years old, which is not supported by the article sentence.

This implies that the foundation's donors have been involved in illegal activities such as drug money laundering, which is consistent with Summary A.\n\nSummary B does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions drug money laundering and does not include the other illegal activities mentioned in the article. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary with the article.","181":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the mother-of-one said the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states \"the mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been.\" The word \"realities\" is plural, and it refers to the various aspects or dimensions of sex.

Doctors told his mother: \"it's a girl.\"\n\nThe article sentence states that \"when Avery Wallace was born, doctors told his parents 'it's a girl'\", which implies that the doctors only told his mother, not his father. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","198":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the property is nicknamed the elk mountain lodge, with multiple cabins overlooking 'trout-soaked ponds'.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article mentions \"6 acres\" and \"multiple cabins overlooking 'trout-soaked ponds'\", which is consistent with Summary A's mention of the property being nicknamed the elk mountain lodge and having multiple cabins overlooking trout-soaked ponds.\n* Summary B mentions \"28-bedroom property\" which is not supported by the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","199":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: she was secretly raped in a&e by a male nurse who filmed the attack.\n\nThis is because the article sentence states that the patient was raped by a male nurse and that the attack was filmed, which is supported by the information in Summary A. The information in Summary B is not directly supported by the article sentence, as it only mentions that the patient tried to kill herself after the police revealed her ordeal, without providing any information about the details of the rape or the identity of the perpetrator.","200":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. a user of a guide dog knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that the user of a guide dog himself knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that the user of a guide dog knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight.\n* Summary B does not accurately capture this information as it omits the phrase \"himself\" and changes the wording of the sentence.","201":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: critics say they do not go far enough to shut hundreds of branches.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that critics say the proposed changes do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country, even when there is no other bank in the community.\n* Summary B captures this information accurately by stating that critics say the changes do not go far enough to shut hundreds of branches.\n* Summary A does not accurately capture the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions shutting up, which is not mentioned in the article sentence.","202":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: cristiano ronaldo included iker casillas and iker casillas.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that most players have been criticized, including Cristiano Ronaldo, but Iker Casillas has been under the most fire.

Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Summary B, on the other hand, focuses on Jenson Button's own performance, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article sentence.","206":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: prince of wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as 'a unique moment'.\n\nThe article sentence only mentions \"a unique moment in anyone's life\" and does not include the phrase \"in anyone's life.\" Therefore, Summary B is not entirely consistent with the article sentence.","207":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. the lion died while it was being transported.\n\nThe article sentence states that the lion died while it was being transported, and this information is not supported by the phrase \"to hospital\" in summary B.

The article states that the current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever, and this confusion is attributed to pornography. Therefore, summary A accurately reflects the information in the article. Summary B is incomplete and does not accurately convey the information in the article, as it only mentions pornography and does not address the broader issue of sexual confusion.","210":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA) she and her husband were trying to walk away.\n\nThe article sentence does not mention the word \"wife,\" so it is not accurate to include that word in the summary.

Summary A accurately captures this information and is therefore more consistent with the article.\n\nIn contrast, Summary B uses the phrase \"bid for,\" which implies a more formal and structured process, and may not accurately convey the intensity and urgency of the competition described in the article sentence.","214":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: france's ruling socialists suffered crushing defeat in regional elections last night.\n\nAll information in this summary is supported by the article, including the fact that the ruling socialists suffered a defeat and that the three years of left-wing rule were branded a \"massive failure.\"\n\nSummary B does not accurately reflect the information in the article, as it only mentions the department being branded a \"massive failure\" and does not mention the regional elections or the ruling socialists. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary with the article.","215":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. he was ordered to pay $167 million in restitution and fines.\n\nThe article sentence mentions restitution and fines, but not damages.

Therefore, the summary that includes all of these people is the most consistent with the article.\n\nSummary B is not consistent with the article because it omits Mick Jagger and instead includes Clint Eastwood twice.","217":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the gunners have been on the 21-year-old's case since last year.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article states that the gunners have been on the 21-year-old's case since last season, which implies that the interest in the player started in the previous year. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that the gunners have been on the player's case since last year.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that the arsenal have been on the player's case since last season, which is not entirely accurate as the article does not mention the word \"arsenal.\" While the article does mention that City are also paying close attention to the player's displays, this information is not included in Summary B.

The phrase \"the europa league\" is not mentioned in the article sentence, so it should not be included in the summary. Additionally, the amount of lost revenue should be written as \"estimated #30 million\" to accurately reflect the information in the article.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","223":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nAnswer: A (giorgio armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what)\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Giorgio Armani created the \"skouser,\" which is a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material.

Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it includes the specific detail of the Christmas special.","230":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed over the peripheral role.\n\nThe article sentence states that Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young prince's life, but the word \"increasingly\" appears only once in the sentence.

Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","232":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: passengers can take their own car and the journey is all part of the experience.\n\nBoth summaries capture the essence of the article sentence, but summary A is more comprehensive and accurately reflects the entire sentence.","233":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: the huygens probe descended onto the surface of saturn's moon titan on 14 january 2005.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"one clip uses audio data collected by the huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of saturn's moon titan on 14 january 2005.\"\n* Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating \"the huygens probe descended onto the surface of saturn's moon titan on 14 january 2005.\"\n* Summary B does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions \"one video\" and does not include the information about the date or the descent onto the surface of Titan.","234":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. hillary clinton's lawyerly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server might extinguish the matter.\n\nThe article sentence states that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct official state department business was improper, and that her lawyerly news conference did not extinguish the matter politically. Therefore, the summary should focus on the fact that Clinton's use of a private email server might be seen as improper, rather than simply stating that it might extinguish the matter for most Americans.","235":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: ms bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in smethwick.\n\nAll information in this summary is supported by the article, including the location (smethwick, west midlands), the manner of death (found dead in a pool of blood), and the presence of her head in the gutter.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is incomplete and lacks information.

The wording of the summary is also consistent with the article sentence, using the same verb tense and phrasing.\n\nIn contrast, Summary B does not accurately capture the information in the article sentence, as it focuses on the cancellation of key services rather than the cancellation of Easter for travellers. Additionally, the wording of Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence, as it uses a different verb tense and phrasing.","238":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: family of condemned drug smuggler andrew chan, his mother helen, and brother michael.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article mentions \"Helen\" as the mother of Andrew Chan, but not as the mother of Michael. Therefore, including \"Helen\" in the summary for Michael would not be consistent with the information in the article.\n* The article only mentions \"Michael\" wearing pink shorts, but does not mention any other information about him. Therefore, including additional information about Michael in the summary would not be consistent with the information in the article.","239":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: left-armer irfan has taken eight wickets in five matches so far.\n\nThe article sentence states that Irfan has taken eight wickets in five matches, which is consistent with Summary A.

Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","248":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: the championship promotion hopefuls had made enquiries about signing jordan rhodes.\n\nThis is because the article sentence states that the championship promotion hopefuls made enquiries about signing Jordan Rhodes, but does not mention anything about Jordan Rhodes making enquiries to Blackburn Rovers. Therefore, Summary B is not consistent with the article.","249":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two.\n\nThis is because the article sentence mentions the individual's physical \"parts\" being set aside, which suggests that the individual identified as a boy from a young age, consistent with Summary A.
