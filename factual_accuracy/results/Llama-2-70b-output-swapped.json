{"output":{"0":" The correct answer is (B) those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) made up radio rental's income, which is not supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by stating that those who receive Centrelink payments (a government benefit) made up half of radio rental's income last year, which is consistent with the information provided in the article.","1":" The correct answer is (B) five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two champions league places.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence uses the phrase \"scramble for two Champions League places,\" which suggests a sense of urgency and competition among the five ambitious clubs vying for these spots. Summary B accurately captures this sense of urgency and competition by using the same phrase, \"scramble for two Champions League places.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A uses the phrase \"bid for two Champions League places,\" which doesn't quite convey the same sense of urgency and competition as the article sentence. The word \"bid\" suggests a more formal and structured process, whereas \"scramble\" implies a more intense and unpredictable competition. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","2":" The correct answer is (B) the 25 year old from pennsylvania went on a level with the likes of beyonce or adele.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that the person became a \"global superstar on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele,\" which implies that they reached a similar level of fame and success as those artists. Summary B accurately reflects this by using the phrase \"went on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele,\" which is consistent with the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A uses the phrase \"went viral on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele,\" which implies that the person's popularity was solely due to their online presence, and doesn't accurately convey the idea of them becoming a global superstar. Therefore, Summary B is a more consistent summary of the article sentence.","3":" The correct answer is (B) seven games involving nimes were investigated after conrad was arrested.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested last November. Summary B accurately summarizes this information by stating that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested, without mentioning the specific month of the arrest. On the other hand, Summary A incorrectly states that seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","4":" The correct answer is (B) driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence specifically states that the driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through. Summary B accurately reflects this information, using the same phrase \"driver's side of the windscreen\" and including the word \"through\" to indicate that the shattered glass falls through the windscreen.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, omits the word \"through\" and changes the wording to \"driver's side were immediately shatters and falls.\" This alteration could potentially mislead the reader into thinking that the driver's side of the windscreen was shattered and fell separately, rather than simultaneously shattering and falling through the windscreen. Therefore, Summary A is less consistent with the article sentence than Summary B.","5":" The correct answer is (B) shafqat hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged thursday.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, which is consistent with Summary B. Summary A, on the other hand, states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, which is not supported by the article. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","6":" The correct answer is (B) sarkozy's electoral alliance has won the departmental elections.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Mr. Sarkozy said \"never in the history of the fifth republic has our political family won so many departments.\" This implies that the electoral alliance led by Mr. Sarkozy has won a significant number of departmental elections.\n\nSummary A states that the alliance has won departmental elections, which is a correct interpretation of the article sentence. However, Summary B provides a more precise and complete summary of the statement by specifying that the alliance has won \"the departmental elections,\" which is a more accurate reflection of the information provided in the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, the more consistent summary with the article sentence is Summary B.","7":" Based on the information provided, the best answer is (B) ** k' can also be included in messages.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that \"terrorist\" and \"d**k\" can also be included in messages. Summary B accurately reflects this information by including the phrase \"** k'\" (which is a censored version of the word \"d**k\") in the list of things that can be included in messages.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, only mentions \"** k\" (without the apostrophe) which is not an exact match to the phrase used in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","8":" The correct answer is (B) insiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions \"miliband's ear\" whereas the article sentence does not mention anything about miliband's ear.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning \"the contrasting pair\" which refers to the two individuals who are rivals for Miliband's attention, as mentioned in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is the better choice.","9":" The correct answer is (B) katarzyne pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by thai transvestite jealous.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions the attacker as a \"thai court\" which is not supported by the article. The article states that the attacker was a \"thai transvestite\" and not a court.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning that the attacker was a \"thai transvestite\" and that the attack was motivated by jealousy over the victim's husband. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","10":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article states that the man named Saleh said that the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, which is correctly reflected in Summary B.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A is not consistent with the article sentence because it suggests that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, and does not mention Saleh appearing in any videos. Therefore, Summary B is the more accurate and consistent summary.","11":" The correct answer is (B) the boxer will instead meet manny pacquaio in a $ 300million mega-fight.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Floyd Mayweather will instead meet Manny Pacquiao in a $300 million mega-fight on May 2. This information is not present in Summary A, which only mentions the Bolton boxer's hope to take on Floyd Mayweather. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it includes the updated information about the boxer's opponent and the fact that the fight will happen on May 2.","12":" The correct answer is (B) the home was built for former australian prime minister malcolm fraser.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that the home was built for inspection, which is not supported by the article. The article states that the home was opened for inspection, but it does not mention that it was built for that purpose.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is consistent with the article sentence as it accurately states that the home was built for former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. This information is supported by the article sentence.","13":" The correct answer is (B) he was unable to use his hands and lying next to several police officers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A suggests that the man was struggling to use his hands, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence states that the man was unable to use his hands, but it does not mention him struggling to use them.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by stating that the man was unable to use his hands and lying next to several police officers. This information is consistent with the article sentence, and it does not add or modify any information that is not present in the original sentence. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","14":" The correct answer is (B) the man who attacked a security area at the New Orleans airport was with a machete and a car containing smoke bombs.\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article because it accurately states that the man had a machete and a car containing smoke bombs, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, incorrectly states that the man had a car containing smoke bombs, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions a bag of molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders, but it does not specify that the man had a car containing smoke bombs.\n\nTherefore, (B) is the correct answer.","15":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: roberto mancini has turned up the heat on manuel pellegrini's successor.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat on his successor Manuel Pellegrini, so the summary should also mention that Mancini is targeting Pellegrini's successor. Summary A does not accurately reflect this and instead suggests that Mancini is targeting Pellegrini's successor's successor, which is not supported by the article.","16":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it includes all the information provided in the article sentence. It mentions that the critics say the measures do not go far enough and that they will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches, which is supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, only mentions that the critics say the measures do not go far enough, but it does not include the additional information about the potential impact on branch closures. Therefore, Summary A is not as consistent with the article sentence as Summary B.","17":" The correct answer is (A) a prized silver dollar each could fetch $10 or more.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that a prized silver dollar could fetch $10 million or more. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by stating that a prized silver dollar could fetch $10 or more, which is consistent with the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that a prized silver dollar could fetch $10 million, which is not entirely consistent with the article. While the article does mention the possibility of fetching $10 million or more, it does not guarantee that amount. Therefore, Summary B is not the best choice.","18":" The correct answer is (A) the toffees were last 16 in a 5-2 loss to dynamo kiev.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the information provided in the sentence. The article states that the toffees were the country's last hope on the continent before a 5-2 loss to dynamo kiev in Europe on Thursday night, which means they were eliminated in the last 16 stage of the competition. Summary A correctly states that the toffees were last 16 in a 5-2 loss to dynamo kiev, which is supported by the information in the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it only mentions that the toffees were the country's last hope on Thursday night, without providing any information about their performance or elimination from the competition. The article sentence does not mention anything about the toffees being the country's last hope on Thursday night, so Summary B does not accurately summarize the information provided in the sentence.","19":" The correct answer is (B) Louis van Gaal says he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that Louis van Gaal said he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total. Summary B accurately reflects this by using the phrase \"he believed\" to indicate that van Gaal is expressing his own opinion about Wenger's estimation. Summary A, on the other hand, omits the word \"he believed\" and instead uses the phrase \"says wenger's estimation,\" which could be interpreted as a direct quote or a paraphrase of van Gaal's statement, but it does not accurately convey the meaning of the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","20":" The correct answer is (B) visitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on friday.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that visitors will be hoping to stay away from the Isle of Lewis on Friday, which is not supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is consistent with the article sentence as it implies that visitors will be hoping that the clouds will stay away on Friday, which is supported by the article sentence.","21":" The correct answer is (B) they claim customers are being driven away by the noises.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it omits the phrase \"despite their attempts to drown out the sounds,\" which is an important part of the sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by including all the necessary information: the claim that customers are being driven away by the noises, and the fact that these noises start around lunchtime.","22":" B","23":" The correct answer is (B) she said freya's friends have been allocated places at a school in beaconsfield.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not mention the name of the town where the school is located, which is mentioned in the article sentence as \"Beaconsfield\".\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning the name of the town where the school is located, and also correctly attributes the statement to Mrs. Jarvis. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","24":" The correct answer is (B) Despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions \"for the first time in a year\" which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions \"for the first time in a while\" which could be any period of time, but not necessarily a year.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by focusing on the fact that the runners consistently found clean air to run in, despite missing chances. This is supported by the article sentence which mentions \"for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in.\"","25":" The correct answer is (B) but now conditions on the farms can be shown for the first time.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23 million chickens a year can be shown for the first time. Summary B accurately reflects this information by stating that conditions on the farms can be shown for the first time, while Summary A only mentions KFC and the number of chickens without mentioning the conditions on the farms. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","26":" The correct answer is (B) she always radiates with a natural beauty, but cate is looking her best.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is inconsistent with the article sentence because it mentions \"needles\" in a way that is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about Cate Blanchett using needles for beauty purposes.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is consistent with the article sentence as it only mentions \"a natural beauty\" and \"looking her best,\" which are both supported by the article.","27":" The correct answer is (B) she and her husband were trying to walk away.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence uses the phrase \"her husband,\" which implies that the person being referred to is male. Summary A uses the phrase \"her wife,\" which is inconsistent with the article sentence and implies a different gender identity for the person being referred to. Summary B, on the other hand, uses the phrase \"her husband,\" which is consistent with the article sentence and accurately reflects the gender identity of the person being referred to. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","28":" The correct answer is (B) brianne altice, 35-year-old brianne, has been charged with rape, sodomy and sex abuse.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately states the age of Brianne Altice as 35 years old, which is mentioned in the article sentence. In contrast, Summary A incorrectly states her age as 21 years old, which is not supported by the article. Additionally, Summary B uses the correct name, \"Brianne Altice,\" whereas Summary A misspells her name as \"brianne altice\" without capitalizing her name. Therefore, Summary B is a more accurate and consistent summary of the article sentence.","29":" The correct answer is (B) fans displayed the messages on bloomfield road ahead of their 3-0 defeat.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the fans displayed the messages on Bloomfield Road ahead of their 3-0 defeat by Charlton Athletic. Summary B accurately reflects this information, whereas Summary A incorrectly states that the team won instead of lost. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","30":" The correct answer is (B) the three and four-year-old boys were snapping at their pyjama elastic.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that all the three and four-year-old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic, which implies that they were still snapping at their pyjama elastic when the speaker and others battened down the hatches.\n\nSummary A only mentions that the three and four-year-old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic, which does not necessarily mean that they were still doing it when the speaker and others battened down the hatches.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it includes the additional detail that the boys were still snapping at their pyjama elastic when the speaker and others battened down the hatches.","31":" The correct answer is (B) ** k' can also be included in messages.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that \"terrorist\" and \"d** k\" can also be included in messages. \"d** k\" is a vulgar term that is sometimes used to refer to a terrorist. Therefore, it is consistent with the article to include \"** k\" in the summary, as it is a reference to the same term mentioned in the article.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, simply states that \"** k\" can also be included in messages, without any context or reference to the article. This is not consistent with the article, as it does not provide any additional information or clarification on the term \"** k\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) ** k' can also be included in messages.","32":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: coach mike catt wants england to be more ruthless.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the main idea of the sentence, which is that coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless. The word \"coach\" is mentioned in the article sentence, and it is important to include it in the summary to provide context and clarity.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, is incomplete and lacks context. It does not convey who Mike Catt is or what his role is, which makes it difficult to understand the statement.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is the better choice as it accurately summarizes the article sentence and provides the necessary context.","33":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: gomis struck three minutes from time at villa park.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Gomis scored a goal three minutes from time at Villa Park, which is consistent with Summary B. Summary A, on the other hand, states that Gomis scored three goals since collapsing at Villa Park, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article does not mention the number of goals Gomis scored, only that he scored a goal three minutes from time at Villa Park. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","34":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the order of events described in the sentence. The sentence states that one should \"load all the luggage you like in the boot\" first, then \"head to the coast\" and finally \"drive aboard the ferry\". Summary B follows this order of events, whereas Summary A reverses the order of the first two steps.","35":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Herrera revealed that Rooney is the joker inside United's dressing room, but not that Rooney has to keep the conversation away from boxing. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article as it only states that Herrera revealed Rooney is the joker, which is supported by the article.","36":" The correct answer is (A) this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence because it includes the phrase \"this day,\" which is present in the original sentence. Omitting \"this day\" in Summary B could potentially change the meaning of the sentence, as it could be interpreted as referring to a different time period. Additionally, Summary A includes the word \"the\" before \"fame\" and \"talent,\" which is also present in the original sentence, whereas Summary B omits them.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is a more accurate summary of the article sentence.","37":" The correct answer is A: prince of wales described as 'unique moment in anyone's life'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as \"a unique moment in anyone's life.\" Summary A accurately quotes the article sentence and is therefore more consistent with it.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, paraphrases the article sentence and omits the phrase \"in anyone's life,\" which is not supported by the article. Therefore, Summary B is less consistent with the article and is not the best choice.","38":" The correct answer is (B) the club has managed to preserve a pastime that requires vast open space.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A states that the club has managed to protect a pastime that is larger than Manhattan, which is not entirely accurate. The article sentence mentions that the club has protected a patchwork of land that is larger than Manhattan, but it does not specify that the pastime itself is larger than Manhattan.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by stating that the club has managed to preserve a pastime that requires vast open space. This summary does not imply that the pastime is larger than Manhattan, but rather that it requires a large amount of open space to be preserved, which is consistent with the information provided in the article sentence.","39":" The correct answer is (B) stuart lancaster's side are yet to win this competition.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that in Stuart Lancaster's fourth year in charge, they (his team) are yet to win this competition. Summary B accurately reflects this information by using the same phrase \"are yet to win\" and correctly identifying the team as \"Stuart Lancaster's side.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A states that Stuart Lancaster's fourth year in charge they will win this competition, which is not consistent with the article sentence. The article does not mention anything about the future or suggest that the team will win the competition. Therefore, Summary A is not supported by the article and is not a factual summary.","40":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: moores, a county county championship winner, finds himself under increasing pressure.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately includes the additional information provided in the article that Moores has won the county championship with both Sussex and Lancashire. This information is relevant to the context of the sentence and helps to further describe Moores' background and achievements.\n\nIn contrast, Summary A only mentions that Moores is under increasing pressure, which is a partial truth but does not fully capture the context and details provided in the article sentence.","41":" The correct answer is A: he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the aspergillus genus.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the information provided in the article sentence. It correctly states that the mold filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is incomplete and lacks clarity. It omits the phrase \"which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice,\" which is an important part of the article sentence. Additionally, it is not clear what \"part of the aspergillus genus\" refers to, as it could be interpreted as meaning that the mold filmed was only a part of the genus and not the entire genus.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary with the article sentence.","42":" The correct answer is (B) the easter bunny was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not accurately reflect the information provided. The article sentence states that the Easter hare was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved, but Summary A suggests that the Easter bunny was invented in German folklore because children had been well-behaved. This is not supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately reflects the information provided in the article sentence. It states that the Easter bunny was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved, which is consistent with the article.","43":" The correct answer is (B) Scotland international made an # 11million move from Leeds in the summer.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that the Scotland international made an # 11million move from Leeds in the summer, but it does not mention Fulham.

Summary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence.","44":" The correct answer is (B) moores, a county championship, finds himself under increasing pressure.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not mention the fact that Moores has won the county championship with both Sussex and Lancashire, which is an important piece of information in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning Moores' achievement of winning the county championship with both Sussex and Lancashire, and also accurately states that he is under increasing pressure to prove himself at the international level. Therefore, Summary B is the better summary of the two.","45":" B","46":" The correct answer is (B) mike catt wants england more ruthless when it comes to scoring points.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it omits the phrase \"scoring points\" which is an important part of the original sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by including the phrase \"scoring points\" and conveying the same meaning as the original sentence.","47":" The correct answer is (B) he was also ordered to pay $ 167 million in restitution and fines.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A uses the term \"damages\" instead of \"restitution\" which is not entirely consistent with the article sentence. While \"damages\" can refer to the harm caused by an action, in this context, \"restitution\" is more appropriate as it refers to the act of restoring something to its rightful owner, which is what the person in question was ordered to do.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, uses the same term \"restitution\" as the article sentence, ensuring consistency and accuracy. Therefore, Summary B is the better choice.","48":" The correct answer is (B) despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it changes the meaning of the original sentence. The article sentence states that the team's strike runners consistently found clean air to run in, but Summary A suggests that the team had a streak of consistently missing chances, which is not supported by the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B accurately summarizes the article sentence by highlighting the fact that the team's runners consistently found clean air to run in, despite missing chances. This summary accurately reflects the meaning and content of the original sentence, making it the better choice.","49":" A. Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence. It provides more specific information that is supported by the article, such as the location of the prime minister's office and the fact that Lee is being treated with antibiotics. Summary B, on the other hand, only states that Lee is on a ventilator in an intensive care unit, which is not specific enough to be considered consistent with the article.","50":" The correct answer is (B) aubrey said he would be eligible when he is five years old.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Aubrey was told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old. Therefore, the summary should also mention \"he\" instead of \"she\" to accurately reflect the information in the article. Summary B does this, while Summary A incorrectly changes the pronoun to \"she.\"","51":" The correct answer is (B) they made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light.\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately states that the features were etched smaller than a wavelength of light, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, states that the features were etched smaller than a wavelength of a silicon film, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention the size of the silicon film, only that it is one thousand times thinner than a human hair. Therefore, Summary A is not consistent with the article.","52":" The correct answer is (B) sebastian vettel is on the podium after sunday's malaysian grand prix.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Sebastian Vettel was on the top step of the podium after the Malaysian Grand Prix, which supports summary B. Summary A, on the other hand, mentions Vettel's move from Red Bull to Ferrari, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article sentence. Therefore, summary B is more consistent with the article.","53":" The correct answer is (B) the club has managed to protect a pastime that requires vast open space.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A states that the club has managed to protect a pastime that is larger than Manhattan, which is not entirely accurate. While the patchwork of land protected by the club is indeed larger than Manhattan, the pastime itself is not necessarily larger than Manhattan.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article's statement by emphasizing that the club has managed to protect a pastime that requires vast open space. This summary does not imply that the pastime itself is larger than Manhattan, but rather that the club has protected a patchwork of land that is sufficient for the pastime to take place. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article's sentence.","54":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"a quote, a motto, from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky\" which suggests that the quote is from Mayakovsky himself. Therefore, Summary B, which attributes the quote to \"the Russian poet\" is more consistent with the article than Summary A, which attributes it to \"the Russian\" without mentioning the poet's name.","55":" B","56":" B","57":" The correct answer is (B) he claims that he was a boy when he was two.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A (he claims he was a young boy when he was two) is not consistent with the article sentence as it adds the word \"young\" which is not present in the original sentence.\n\nSummary B (he claims that he was a boy when he was two) is consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the claim made in the article without adding or modifying any information.","58":" The correct answer is (B) Lucy Powell, 40, became embroiled in a dispute over Powell's Brit Awards plans.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the information provided in the article.

Summary A, on the other hand, only mentions Lucy Powell's involvement in a dispute over \"ms powell's brit,\" which is not a precise representation of the information in the article. Therefore, Summary B is the better choice.","59":" I would choose summary B: the man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to pummel her.\n\nThe article sentence specifically states that the man begins to pummel the young girl with a large stone, so summary B is more consistent with the article as it includes the detail about the man beginning to pummel the girl.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, does not include the detail about the man beginning to pummel the girl, and instead only mentions the man forcing the girl to the ground and beginning with a large stone, which could potentially be interpreted as the man simply holding the stone and not actually using it to harm the girl. Therefore, summary A is less consistent with the article.","60":" The correct answer is A.\n\nThe article sentence states that Clinton said \"the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.\" Summary A accurately quotes Clinton's statement, using the same phrase \"vast majority\" and accurately paraphrasing the rest of the sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, changes the phrase \"vast majority\" to \"majority,\" which could potentially be misleading or inaccurate. It is important to maintain the exact wording and meaning of the original statement, especially when it comes to quotes or paraphrasing. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","61":" The correct answer is (B) passengers face travel chaos this easter as britain's busiest rail routes are expected.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A omits the word \"expected\" which is present in the original sentence, which means it doesn't convey the full meaning of the sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, includes the word \"expected\" which indicates that the engineering projects are not yet certain and are subject to change, which is consistent with the tone of the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","62":" The correct answer is (B) aubrey said she was told he was eligible when he is five years old.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that Aubrey was told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old. Summary B accurately reflects this information by using the phrase \"she was told\" and \"he is five years old,\" which are both supported by the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A omits the phrase \"she was told\" and changes \"her son\" to \"she,\" which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","63":" The correct answer is (B) atlanta falcons have been fined # 237,000 for use of fake crowd noise.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence specifically mentions \"fake crowd noise\" as the reason for the fine, whereas Summary A only mentions \"fake crowd.\" While it's possible that the fake crowd noise was part of a larger fake crowd, the article sentence does not explicitly support this interpretation. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it specifically mentions \"fake crowd noise\" like the article sentence does.","64":" The correct answer is (B) pearce has been in charge of england under-21s for six years.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Stuart Pearce was in charge of England under-21s for six years, which is consistent with summary B.

The sentence uses the same wording as the article sentence, which suggests that the coach said exactly that.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, is an incorrect paraphrasing of the article sentence. It suggests that the coach's statement was \"the world cup winner has been 'ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good'\", which is not what the article sentence states.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.","66":" The correct answer is (B) but now conditions on the farms that supply kfc with 23million chickens a year can be shown.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it omits the phrase \"but now\" and implies that KFC itself can be shown for the first time, which is not supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by emphasizing that the conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23 million chickens a year can be shown for the first time. This is consistent with the article's focus on revealing the previously unknown conditions on the farms that supply KFC.","67":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A adds the word \"increasingly\" twice, which is not present in the original sentence. This changes the meaning of the sentence and makes it inconsistent with the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence without adding any extra information. It correctly states that Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young prince's life. Therefore, Summary B is the better choice.","68":" The correct answer is A: the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the information provided in the article sentence. It correctly states that the thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, omits the detail about the chickens living in huge sheds, which is an important aspect of the article sentence. It only states that the thousands of chickens live together for just 35 days before they are gassed, which is not a complete representation of the information provided in the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence than Summary B.","69":" The correct answer is (B) passengers can take their own car and the journey is all part of experience.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is inconsistent with the article sentence as it misses the word \"experience\" at the end of the sentence. The article sentence emphasizes that the journey is not just a means to an end, but also a part of the overall experience.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately captures the essence of the article sentence by including the word \"experience\" at the end, which suggests that the journey itself is an enjoyable and memorable part of the trip. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","70":" The correct answer is (B) beleaguered travellers warned that easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that travellers have been warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned, and that many key services will be axed. Summary B accurately reflects this information by stating that beleaguered travellers have been warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A mentions that beleaguered trains are concerned and many key services will be axed, which is not a accurate summary of the article sentence. The article does not mention anything about the trains being beleaguered, but rather the travellers who are affected by the cancellation of train services during Easter. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","71":" B","72":" The correct answer is (B) she was told to 'get and interpreter' by staff at port orange post office.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that the deaf woman was told to \"get an interpreter\" by staff at the Port Orange post office. Summary B accurately reflects this information by using the word \"told\" to indicate that the staff instructed the woman to get an interpreter. Summary A, on the other hand, uses the phrase \"asked to,\" which implies a more polite and less direct request, and may not accurately convey the full meaning of the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","73":" The correct answer is (B) migrants who come to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation's borders.

Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","74":" The correct answer is (B) The russian poet says it is 'better to die from vodka than from boredom'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that there is a quote from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky on the person's Facebook, which suggests that the quote is not a direct statement from the person but rather a quote from another source. Therefore, it is more consistent to use the phrase \"the Russian poet says\" instead of \"the Russian says\" to indicate that the quote is from Mayakovsky.\n\nAdditionally, using quotation marks around the phrase \"better to die from vodka than from boredom\" in summary B helps to clarify that it is a quote from Mayakovsky and not a paraphrased statement. This helps to ensure that the summary is consistent with the article sentence and accurately represents the information provided.","75":" B","76":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence specifically mentions that Alonso's steering wheel locked and that this caused his pre-season testing crash in Barcelona.

Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","77":" A","78":" I would choose summary B as the more consistent summary.\n\nSummary A omits the fact that the man forces the young girl to the ground, which is a crucial detail provided in the article sentence. Additionally, summary A suggests that the man is pummeling the ground, which is not supported by the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, summary B accurately summarizes the article sentence by stating that the man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to pummel her. This summary includes all the necessary information from the article sentence and does not introduce any additional, unsupported details. Therefore, summary B is the more consistent summary.","79":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it uses the same term (\"glass users\") as the article sentence, whereas Summary A uses a different term (\"glass glass users\").

This information is supported by the article sentence, which states that Professor Armbruster said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","81":" The correct answer is (B) chelsea's izzy brown has been named in sean o'driscoll's european qualifiers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"chelsea's izzy brown\" specifically, so it is important to include the name \"izzy brown\" in the summary. Summary A does not include the name \"izzy brown\" and instead refers to \"chelsea\" alone, which is not consistent with the article sentence. Summary B, on the other hand, includes the name \"izzy brown\" and accurately reflects the information provided in the article sentence.","82":" The correct answer is (B) passengers can look at fish while staying dry and is small.\n\nExplanation:\nSummary A states that passengers can look at fish while staying on a yacht, which is not entirely accurate as the article mentions that the submarine can dive to depths of up to 300ft, allowing passengers to look at fish while staying dry.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article's information by stating that passengers can look at fish while staying dry and the submarine is small enough to be stowed on a yacht. This summary provides a more consistent representation of the article's content.","83":" The correct answer is (B) the ex-chief of defence staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not accurately reflect the full statement made by the ex-chief of defence staff. The article sentence specifically states that he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched his home in Surrey, whereas Summary A only states that he was 'mystified' about the police.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B accurately summarizes the article sentence by including the full statement made by the ex-chief of defence staff, including the reason for his mystification (i.e. the police search of his home in Surrey). Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","84":" The correct answer is (B) kane is one of the most talked about players in the country.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Kane is one of the most talked about players in the country, which is consistent with summary B.

It also accurately states that the victim was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic, which is also supported by the article. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","87":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reports that Tina Fey's follow-up to 30 Rock is getting a lot of attention, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, omits the fact that the follow-up is getting attention and only focuses on the fact that not all of it is good, which is not the main point of the article sentence.","88":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: ` ninety-nine per cent of things were very good,' said the world cup winner.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it attributes the statement \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good\" to the world cup winner, whereas the article sentence states that the world cup winner said \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good.\"\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by using quotes to indicate that the statement \"ninety-nine per cent of things were very good\" was made by the world cup winner.

Therefore, it is the more consistent summary.","188":" The correct answer is (B) insiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions \"miliband's ear and head\" which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions \"the starkly contrasting pair\" and does not mention anything about their relationship with Miliband's ear or head.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning \"the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair\" which is supported by the article.","189":" The correct answer is (B) more than 90% said their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that more than 90% of people with certain cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate) said that their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis. Summary B accurately reflects this information by using the phrase \"their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis,\" which is consistent with the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A omits the phrase \"their doctors\" and simply states that more than 90% said they had no problem giving them the diagnosis, which is not a direct quote from the article and could be interpreted as a slightly different statement. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","190":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nThe article sentence states that Phelps' punishment resulted in him being excluded from the US team for the World Championships in Kazan. This is consistent with Summary B, which states that Phelps' punishment was excluded from the US team for the World Championships.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A states that Phelps' punishment was due to run out in early hours, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article does not mention anything about the duration of Phelps' punishment or when it was due to end. Therefore, Summary A is not consistent with the article sentence.","191":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it only states that the man scored a 180 in a charity darts event, which is supported by the article. Summary A, on the other hand, adds the additional information that the man was deemed to be blind, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that the man was investigated for benefit fraud after he scored a 180 in a charity darts event, and does not provide any information about his visual ability. Therefore, Summary B is a more accurate summary of the article sentence.","192":" The correct answer is (B) she always radiates with a natural beauty and relies on some beauty secrets.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is inconsistent with the article sentence as it mentions \"needles\" twice, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions \"needles\" once in the context of Cate Blanchett avoiding going under the knife or being jabbed with needles.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by highlighting Cate Blanchett's natural beauty and her reliance on beauty secrets to maintain her appearance. This summary is consistent with the article as it only includes information that is supported by the article.","193":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article mentions that President Barack Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the Middle East, which is the main focus of the sentence.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article sentence. While it is true that the world is mentioned in the article sentence, the focus of the sentence is on President Obama's actions and the nonproliferation deal, not on the world's actions or actions taken by other countries. Therefore, Summary A does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article.","194":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the second draft law would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. This means that the law would affect women who do not have children, regardless of whether they choose not to have children or are unable to have children.\n\nSummary A, \"second draft law would close many women who choose not to have children,\" is inconsistent with the article sentence because it implies that the law would only affect women who choose not to have children, and not those who are unable to have children.\n\nSummary B, \"second draft law is to go before parliament next month,\" is consistent with the article sentence because it accurately states that the law is to be presented to parliament next month, which is mentioned in the article sentence.","195":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the content of the article. The article states that Clinton \"doggedly parried suggestions\" that her use of a private email server was improper, and Summary B uses the same phrase \"doggedly parried suggestions\" to describe Clinton's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article does not say that Clinton \"doggedly suggestions\" anything; rather, it says that she \"doggedly parried suggestions\" that her use of a private email server was improper. Additionally, Summary A suggests that Clinton's actions might \"extinguish the matter for most Americans,\" but the article does not make this claim.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","196":" The correct answer is (B) bale has received a lot of criticism but silenced his doubters.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that Bale was silenced by the La Liga double, which is not supported by the article. The article states that Bale silenced his doubters with a La Liga double, meaning that he was the one who silenced his critics, not the other way around.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by stating that Bale received criticism but silenced his doubters. This is consistent with the article as it indicates that Bale was criticized but was able to shut down his critics with his performance.","197":" The correct answer is (B) doctors told his mother: 'it's a girl'.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that doctors told Avery Wallace's parents that it's a girl. The word \"parents\" is plural, indicating that both mother and father were present. Summary B uses the phrase \"doctors told his mother,\" which is consistent with the article sentence as it implies that the doctors told both parents.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A uses the phrase \"doctors told his parents,\" which could be interpreted as the doctors telling only one parent (either the mother or father), and not both. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","198":" The correct answer is A: the 28-bedroom property is nicknamed the mountain lodge, with multiple cabins overlooking 'trout-soaked ponds'\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that the property has multiple cabins overlooking 'trout-soaked ponds' and that it was originally built to be used as a bed and breakfast or wedding party venue. Summary A accurately summarizes this information by referring to the property as the \"mountain lodge\" and mentioning the cabins overlooking 'trout-soaked ponds'.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B refers to the property as the \"elk mountain lodge\", which is not mentioned in the article sentence. While it is true that the property is located in a mountainous area and may have elk present, the article does not provide enough information to support the use of this name. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","199":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nThe article sentence explicitly states that the patient tried to kill herself after the police revealed her ordeal, which aligns with Summary B. Summary A, on the other hand, attributes the attempt to kill herself to the police, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","200":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article mentions that the person in question is a user of a guide dog, and that they knew how important guide dogs could be for individuals with impaired sight. Summary B correctly states that the person is a user of a guide dog and acknowledges their personal experience with impaired sight.\n\nIn contrast, Summary A omits the fact that the person is a user of a guide dog and instead refers to them as a user of a guide. This is not supported by the article sentence, which specifically mentions that the person uses a guide dog. Therefore, Summary A is less consistent with the article sentence than Summary B.","201":" The correct answer is A: critics say they do not go far enough to shut hundreds of branches.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A accurately summarizes the article sentence by highlighting the main concern of the critics, which is that the regulations do not go far enough in addressing the issue of bank branch closures. The phrase \"to shut hundreds of branches\" is also consistent with the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence. The phrase \"to shut up\" is not related to the topic of bank branch closures and does not accurately summarize the critics' concerns. Therefore, Summary B is not a good summary of the article sentence.","202":" The correct answer is (B) cristiano ronaldo included cristiano ronaldo and iker casillas.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Cristiano Ronaldo was criticized, and that Iker Casillas was also criticized and perhaps more so. Summary B accurately reflects this information by including both Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas as individuals who were criticized.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A only includes Iker Casillas as an individual who was criticized, and does not accurately represent the fact that Cristiano Ronaldo was also criticized. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","203":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. According to the article, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, sound systems, and other home theatre devices. Summary B correctly states that $45 million was used for entertainment items, and includes the specific examples of flat screen televisions, sound systems, and other home theatre devices.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A does not accurately summarize the information provided in the article. While it mentions smart phones, which are indeed mentioned in the article, it does not mention the other entertainment items that the article mentions, such as flat screen televisions and sound systems. Therefore, Summary A is not consistent with the article.","204":" The correct answer is (B) the ex-chief of defence staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched his.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not mention the specific reason for the ex-chief of defence staff's mystification, which is the police search of his home in Surrey.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by mentioning the reason for the ex-chief of defence staff's mystification, which is the police search of his home in Surrey. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","205":" The correct answer is (B) jenson button was happy to see mclaren be competitive at the malaysian grand prix.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Summary B accurately reflects this information by using the phrase \"see McLaren be competitive\" which is consistent with the original sentence.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, changes the meaning of the sentence by saying that Jenson Button was happy to be more competitive, which is not exactly what the article says. It implies that Jenson Button's personal performance was the reason for his happiness, whereas the article states that he was happy to see his team, McLaren, perform better. Therefore, Summary A is not consistent with the article sentence.","206":" The correct answer is A: prince of wales described becoming a first-time 'unique moment in anyone's life'.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as \"a unique moment in anyone's life.\" Summary A accurately quotes the article by including the full phrase \"unique moment in anyone's life,\" whereas Summary B omits the phrase \"in anyone's life,\" which is not a minor detail. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","207":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nThe article sentence states that the lion died while it was being transported, and Summary B accurately summarizes this information without adding any additional details. Summary A, on the other hand, adds the detail that the lion was being transported to a hospital, which is not supported by the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","208":" The correct answer is (B) ms bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in smethwick, west midlands.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is inconsistent with the article sentence as it omits the phrase \"violent battering\" and the time frame \"moments after\" which are both crucial information provided in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, includes all the information present in the article sentence, including the phrase \"violent battering\" and the time frame \"moments after\", making it a more consistent summary.","209":" The correct answer is (B) the current generation of young people is confused about sex ever because of pornography.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence states that the current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Summary B accurately reflects this statement by mentioning that the confusion is about sex, not just pornography, and that it is because of pornography. Summary A, on the other hand, only mentions confusion about pornography, which is not entirely consistent with the article sentence.","210":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nThe article sentence uses the phrase \"her husband,\" which implies that the person being referred to is male. Summary A uses the phrase \"her wife,\" which implies that the person being referred to is female. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","211":" The correct answer is (B) pearce has been in charge of england under-21s for six years.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that \"Pearce, who was in charge of England under-21s for six years\" which matches summary B. Summary A mentions Neville, who is not mentioned in the article sentence. Therefore, summary B is more consistent with the article.","212":" The correct answer is (B) one clip uses audio data collected by the huygens probe.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A states \"one video uses audio data collected by the huygens probe,\" which is not entirely consistent with the article sentence. The article sentence specifically mentions that the audio data was collected as the probe descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on a specific date (January 14, 2005). Summary A does not mention the specific date or the fact that the data was collected during descent, so it is not consistent with the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states \"one clip uses audio data collected by the huygens probe,\" which is consistent with the article sentence. It does not provide any additional information that is not supported by the article, and it accurately reflects the fact that the audio data was collected by the huygens probe. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","213":" The correct answer is (B) five clubs are locked in a scramble for two champions league places.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A omits the word \"scramble\" which is present in the original sentence, and it also changes the phrase \"behind Chelsea and Manchester City\" to \"in a bid\". These changes make the summary less consistent with the original sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B accurately retains the word \"scramble\" and maintains the same meaning as the original sentence. Therefore, it is a more consistent summary of the article sentence.","214":" B. The correct answer is B.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the content of the article. The article states that the ruling socialists suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections, and this is correctly summarized in Summary B.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A is not consistent with the article sentence. While the article mentions that the left-wing rule has been branded a \"massive failure,\" it does not mention anything about the ruling department. Therefore, Summary A is not supported by the information in the article and is not a accurate summary of the article sentence.","215":" The correct answer is (B) he was ordered to pay $ 167 million in restitution and fines.\n\nExplanation:\nSummary A uses the term \"damages\" instead of \"restitution,\" which is not exactly the same thing. Restitution refers to the act of restoring something to its rightful owner, or compensating someone for a loss or injury. Damages, on the other hand, refer to the amount of money that a person is entitled to receive as compensation for a loss or injury.\n\nWhile the article sentence mentions both restitution and fines, Summary A only mentions damages and fines, which is not a precise summary of the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by using the same terms as the original sentence: restitution and fines. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","216":" The correct answer is (B) paul mccartney, bob dylan, clint eastwood and hm the queen.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it includes Clint Eastwood twice, which is not supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by listing the four individuals mentioned: Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood, and HM the Queen.","217":" The correct answer is (B) the gunners have been on the 21-year-old's case since last year.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that the Gunners have been on the 21-year-old's case since last season, which implies that the team has been monitoring the player's performance for at least a year. Summary B accurately reflects this information by stating that the Gunners have been on the player's case since last year, whereas Summary A only mentions that the team has been on the player's case since last season, which could imply a shorter period of time. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","218":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence because it accurately reports the statement made by Katie without adding any extraneous information. The article sentence does not mention Danny Mas, so it is not appropriate to include him in the summary. Additionally, Summary B more accurately reflects the quote from Katie, as it does not include the name of the person she was addressing.","219":" The correct answer is (B) phelps' punishment was excluded from the us team for the world championships.\n\nThe article sentence states that Phelps' punishment resulted in him being excluded from the US team for the World Championships in Kazan.

However, the article sentence states \"i'm in a basement in central london,\" indicating that the speaker is currently in the basement.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states \"i'm is in a basement in central london,\" which is consistent with the article sentence as it indicates that the speaker is currently in the basement.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","222":" The correct answer is (B) The europa league must swallow an estimated # 30million in lost revenue.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article sentence mentions that those who do not join Europe's elite next season must swallow an estimated # 30million in lost revenue, and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. This implies that the Europa League itself is not responsible for swallowing the lost revenue, but rather the teams that do not join Europe's elite will have to bear the cost.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it correctly states that the Europa League must swallow the estimated # 30million in lost revenue, which is a consequence of the teams' failure to join Europe's elite.","223":" The correct answer is A: giorgio armani gave the 'skouser' of slim-fitting trousers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. The article sentence mentions that Giorgio Armani created the \"skouser,\" which is a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material. Summary A correctly states that Giorgio Armani gave the \"skouser\" of slim-fitting trousers, which is a concise and accurate summary of the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it does not accurately summarize the information provided. Summary B only states that Giorgio Armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what, which does not specify what exactly he created. The article sentence provides more specific information about the creation, stating that it was a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material. Therefore, Summary B does not accurately summarize the information in the article sentence.","224":" The correct answer is (B) he told eva merkacheva and andrey babushkin he had been tortured and the well-being of his family.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the person told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin that he had been tortured and the well-being of his family and friends were threatened.\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it implies that Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin were tortured, which is not supported by the article.\n\nSummary B is consistent with the article sentence as it accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. It states that the person told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin that he had been tortured and the well-being of his family was threatened, which is supported by the article sentence.","225":" The correct answer is (B).\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the information provided in the article. The article states that the man named Saleh said that the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos was a senior figure in the extremist organization responsible for murdering foreign captives. Summary B correctly states that the man named Saleh said the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, which is supported by the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A is not consistent with the article as it implies that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, not Saleh. Therefore, Summary B is the more accurate and consistent summary.","226":" The correct answer is (B) mr salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A suggests that Mr. Salamone went upstairs to find her dead after sleeping on the sofa, which is not supported by the article sentence. The article sentence states that Mr. Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by stating that Mr. Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs, which is consistent with the information provided in the article sentence.","227":" The correct answer is A: sportscaster fred katz's crazy eyes warren on orange is the new black.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Fred Katz, a sportscaster, challenged Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba (who plays Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on Orange is the New Black) to share a Lady and the Tramp licorice. Therefore, the correct summary should mention Fred Katz and Crazy Eyes Warren, which is mentioned in Summary A.\n\nSummary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it mentions \"the crazy eyes warren on orange is the black\" which is not a correct phrase and does not accurately summarize the article sentence.","228":" The correct answer is (B) Summary B: jury heard the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A states that the jury was told that the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages, which implies that the information was presented to the jury as a fact. However, the article sentence only mentions that the jury heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages, which suggests that the information was presented as evidence or testimony, rather than as a established fact.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence as it uses the phrase \"jury heard\" which aligns with the idea that the information was presented as evidence or testimony.","229":" The correct answer is (B) matthew crawley asked lady mary to marry him in the first downton abbey christmas.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence specifically mentions that the proposal took place in the first Downton Abbey Christmas special, which was broadcast in 2011. Summary B includes the word \"christmas\" which is consistent with the article sentence, whereas Summary A does not mention \"christmas\" and is therefore less consistent with the article.","230":" The correct answer is (B) charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed over the peripheral role.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence uses the phrase \"peripheral role he occupies in the young prince's life,\" which suggests that Charles is perplexed about the role he plays in the young prince's life. Summary B accurately reflects this by using the phrase \"peripheral role\" and the word \"over\" to convey that Charles is perplexed about the role he plays.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A uses the phrase \"increasingly increasingly perplexed\" which doesn't accurately convey the meaning of the article sentence. The word \"increasingly\" is unnecessary in this context, and it changes the meaning of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","231":" B. The correct answer is B: police have launched a investigation into the 'unexplained death' of sophia walker.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence uses the phrase \"unexplained death,\" which implies that the cause of Sophia Walker's death is not yet known or understood. Summary B uses the same phrase, \"unexplained death,\" which is consistent with the article sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary A uses the phrase \"tragic death,\" which implies that the death was unexpected and sad, but it does not convey the same level of uncertainty or mystery as the phrase \"unexplained death.\" Therefore, Summary A is not as consistent with the article sentence as Summary B.","232":" The correct answer is (B) passengers can take their own car and journey is all part of the experience.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it misses out on the phrase \"all part of the experience\" which is an important aspect of the sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article sentence by including the phrase \"all part of the experience\" which indicates that the journey itself is an enjoyable and significant part of the travel experience.

The article states that Hillary Clinton's lawyerly news conference might extinguish the matter for most Americans, but it doesn't get Clinton out of the woods politically.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately summarizes the article by stating that Hillary Clinton's lawyerly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server might extinguish the matter. This is consistent with the article's statement that Clinton doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server was improper.","235":" The correct answer is (B) ms bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in smethwick.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is inconsistent with the article sentence as it misses the information about the cause of death, which is mentioned in the article sentence as \"violent battering\".\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, includes all the information present in the article sentence, including the location, the condition of the body, and the fact that it was a violent death. Therefore, it is the more consistent summary.","236":" The correct answer is (B) they have been transferred to nusakambangan island where they are expected to be executed.\n\nExplanation: The article states that the individuals have been on death row since 2005 and are now being transferred to Nusakambangan Island where they are expected to be executed this week.

Restitution refers to the act of restoring something to its rightful owner, or compensating them for losses or harm suffered. Damages, on the other hand, refer to the amount of money that a person is entitled to receive as compensation for a loss or injury.\n\nIn the context of the article sentence, the phrase \"restitution and fines\" is used, which suggests that the $167 million amount refers to both restitution (compensation for harm suffered) and fines (punishment for wrongdoing).
