{"output":{"0":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary B: those who receive centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that \"those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year.\" Therefore, the summary that best reflects this information is Summary B, which states \"those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of radio rental's income last year.\"\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, states \"the abc have reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up radio rental's income last year.\" This summary is not as precise and factual as Summary B, as it does not directly quote the information from the article and instead uses indirect language to convey the same information.","1":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two champions league places.\n\nThe word \"scramble\" implies a more intense and competitive situation, which is consistent with the article's statement that the race for the two Champions League places could be more tense and exciting than the Premier League title race itself. In contrast, Summary A's use of the word \"bid\" does not convey the same level of intensity and competition.","2":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: the 25 year old from pennsylvania went on a level with the likes of beyonce or adele.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the 25 year old from pennsylvania became a global superstar on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele, indicating that they reached a similar level of success.\n\nSummary A uses the phrase \"went viral,\" which is not supported by the article sentence. While the article does mention that the person became a global superstar, it does not mention anything about them going viral.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately states that the person went on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele, which is supported by the article sentence.","3":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary B: seven games involving nimes were investigated after conrad was arrested.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested last November. Summary B accurately reflects this information by stating that the games were investigated after Conrad's arrest. Summary A, on the other hand, is not consistent with the article as it states that the games were arrested, which is not supported by the information in the article.","4":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: driver's side were immediately shatters and falls through.\n\nExplanation: The verb tense in the article sentence is past simple (\"immediately shatters and falls through\"), so the summary should also be in the past simple tense (\"were\" instead of \"is\") to maintain consistency. Additionally, \"falls through\" is a more precise wording than \"falls\" to accurately convey the idea that the shattered windshield falls through the car.","5":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: shafqat hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on wednesday.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the government official confirmed on Wednesday night that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. Therefore, Wednesday is the correct day mentioned in the article, and Summary A accurately reflects that information. Summary B incorrectly states that the hanging was scheduled for Thursday.","6":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections.\n\nThe article sentence states that Mr. Sarkozy referred to the ump's electoral alliance with the Centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) and mentioned that never in the history of the fifth republic has their political family won so many departments. This implies that the electoral alliance has won departmental elections, which is consistent with Summary A.","7":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: ** k'' can also be included in messages.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that \"terrorist\" and \"d ** k\" can also be included in messages, and \"** k''\" is a more comprehensive and accurate term that includes both \"terrorist\" and \"d ** k\". Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","8":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair,\" and \"Miliband's ear,\" which suggests that the tensions were between Miliband and someone else, likely a rival for his ear. Summary A accurately captures this information by mentioning \"Miliband's ear.\"","9":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: katarzyne pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai court.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that the attacker was a \"Thai transvestite,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in Summary B.\n* The article sentence also mentions that the attack took place in \"the east coast Thai city of Pattaya,\" which is not included in Summary B.\n* Both summaries correctly mention the victim's age (42) and the type of weapon used (stiletto).\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the information provided in the article sentence.","10":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the man, named only as saleh, said the masked militant appears in several beheading videos.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the article sentence, the man named Saleh said that the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos is a senior figure in the extremist organization responsible for murdering foreign captives. However, the summary A states that the man, named only as Saleh, appears in several beheading videos, which is not supported by the article sentence. On the other hand, summary B correctly states that the man, named only as Saleh, said the masked militant appears in several beheading videos, which is consistent with the article sentence.","11":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the boxer will instead meet manny pacquaio in a $ 300million mega-fight.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the bolton boxer had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather, but the pound-for-pound king will instead meet Manny Pacquiao in a $300 million mega-fight on May 2. Therefore, Summary B accurately reflects the information in the article by stating that the boxer will instead meet Manny Pacquiao in a $300 million mega-fight.\n\nSummary A does not accurately reflect the information in the article, as it only mentions taking on Floyd Mayweather, without mentioning Manny Pacquiao or the $300 million mega-fight.","12":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that the home was built for former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie, and that it has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. Summary B, on the other hand, only mentions that the home was built for former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, which is not explicitly stated in the article sentence.","13":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: he was unable to use his hands and lying next to several police officers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries include the information that the man was unable to use his hands, but only Summary B includes the information that he was lying next to several police officers. This information is not present in Summary A. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","14":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the man who attacked a security area at the new orleans airport with a machete and a car containing smoke bombs.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article mentions that the man had a machete and wasp spray, but it does not mention the car containing smoke bombs. Therefore, Summary B is not entirely accurate.\n* Summary A includes all the information mentioned in the article, including the machete and the car containing smoke bombs.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary of the article.","15":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nA. Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat for Manuel Pellegrini's successor.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Roberto Mancini has claimed that Manuel Pellegrini's successor should be winning a trophy every year, which implies that the heat is being turned up for the successor, not directly on Manuel Pellegrini. Therefore, summary A is a more accurate representation of the article's content.","16":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: critics say they do not go far enough to shut hundreds of branches.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that critics say the proposed regulations do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country, even when there is no other bank in the community. Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that critics say the regulations do not go far enough to shut hundreds of branches.","17":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: a prized silver dollar each could fetch $ 10 or more.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states \"and a prized silver dollar each could fetch $ 10 million or more.\" which implies that the value of each silver dollar could be more than $10 million.\n\nSummary A correctly captures this information by stating \"a prized silver dollar each could fetch $ 10 or more.\" which implies that the value of each silver dollar could be anywhere above $10.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states \"a prized silver dollar each could fetch $ 10 million\" which is not entirely accurate as the article does not specify a fixed value of $10 million, but rather a range of values above $10 million.","18":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: the toffees were last 16 in a 5-2 loss to dynamo kiev.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that the toffees were the country's last hope on the continent before losing to Dynamo Kiev.\n* The summary A accurately captures this information by stating that the toffees were last 16 in a 5-2 loss to Dynamo Kiev.\n* The summary B does not accurately capture the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions that the toffees were the country's last hope on Thursday night, without mentioning the loss to Dynamo Kiev.","19":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: louis van gaal says wenger's estimation of the necessary points total.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Louis van Gaal believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total, which is a statement about Wenger's belief. Therefore, the summary should reflect that Wenger's belief is the subject of the sentence, rather than just stating that Louis van Gaal believed it. Summary A accurately conveys this information by using the phrase \"wenger's estimation of the necessary points total\".","20":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: visitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on friday.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that visitors will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday for the solar eclipse, so the summary should reflect that exact information. Summary B does so, while Summary A is inconsistent with the article by stating that visitors will be hoping to stay away on Friday, which is not mentioned in the article.","21":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary B: they claim customers are being driven away by the noises.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the customers are being driven away by the noises, which starts around lunchtime. Therefore, Summary B accurately reflects the information in the article by stating that customers are being driven away by the noises. Summary A only states that they claim they are being driven away by the noises, which is not as specific or detailed as Summary B.","22":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: captured at 1,500 frames per second.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries capture the frame rate of the video, but only Summary B accurately reflects the language of the article sentence. The article sentence states that the video was captured \"at\" 1,500 frames per second, which is explicitly included in Summary B. In contrast, Summary A only states that the video was captured \"by\" 1,500 frames per second, which is not entirely accurate.","23":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: she said freya's friends have been allocated places at a school in beaconsfield.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"most of freya's friends\" have been allocated places at a school, which is specific and implies that not all of Freya's friends have been allocated places.\n* Summary B accurately reflects this information by specifying that Freya's friends have been allocated places at a school in Beaconsfield, which is a specific location.\n* Summary A does not provide this specific information and is therefore less consistent with the article sentence.","24":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"for the first time in a while\" which implies that the team's strike runners have consistently found clean air to run in, despite missing chances against Scotland.\n* Summary B captures this information accurately, while Summary A does not mention \"for the first time in a while\" and only mentions \"for the first time in a year,\" which is not supported by the article sentence.","25":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: but now conditions on the farms can be shown for the first time.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"but now conditions on the farms that supply kfc with 23million chickens a year can be shown for the first time.\" The sentence emphasizes that the conditions on the farms are being shown for the first time, rather than just the number of chickens supplied to KFC. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","26":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: she always radiates with needles, but cate has avoided going under the knife.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that she always radiates with a natural beauty, but she has avoided going under the knife or being jabbed with needles. Summary A captures this information accurately, while Summary B does not mention the avoidance of going under the knife or being jabbed with needles. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","27":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the most consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: she and husband were trying to walk away.\n\nThe article sentence does not mention the gender of the person's spouse, so it is not appropriate to use the term \"wife\" in the summary. Using \"husband\" instead is a more neutral and accurate term, as it does not make any assumptions about the gender of the person's spouse.","28":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: brianne altice, 21, has been charged with rape, sodomy and sex abuse.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that Brianne Altice, a 35-year-old former teacher, has been charged with 14 felonies, including rape, sodomy, and sex abuse, for allegedly having sexual relationships with three different students.\n* Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that Brianne Altice, 21, has been charged with rape, sodomy, and sex abuse.\n* Summary B is not consistent with the article sentence as it states that Brianne Altice is 35 years old, which is not supported by the article. Additionally, it does not accurately reflect the charges that Brianne Altice has been charged with.","29":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: fans displayed the messages on bloomfield road ahead of their 3-0 defeat.\n\nThe article states that the fans displayed the messages ahead of their 3-0 defeat by Charlton Athletic, which is consistent with Summary B.","30":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the three and boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic.\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"all the three and four-year-old boys\" engaging in the behavior, but the summary should focus on the specific behavior mentioned, which is snapping at their pyjama elastic. Therefore, the correct answer is Summary A.","31":" Based on the article sentence, the correct answer is (B) ** k' can also be included in messages.\n\nThe article sentence states that \"terrorist\" and \"d ** k\" can also be included in messages, indicating that the asterisked word can be any word, including \"k\". Therefore, the correct summary should include the asterisked word as \"k'\", which is consistent with the information in the article.\n\nSummary A, which only includes \"k\" without the asterisk, is not consistent with the article sentence.","32":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: mike catt wants england to be more ruthless when it comes.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"england coach mike catt\" and \"scoring points,\" which suggests that the focus is on the team's performance and not just the coach's wishes.\n* Summary A includes the phrase \"when it comes,\" which acknowledges the context of the team's performance and emphasizes the importance of being ruthless in that context.\n* Summary B simply states \"coach mike catt wants england to be more ruthless,\" which does not provide the same level of context and specificity as Summary A.","33":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: gomis struck three minutes from time at villa park.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Gomis scored three minutes from time at Villa Park, which is consistent with Summary B. Summary A is not supported by the article as there is no information about Gomis scoring three goals since collapsing at Villa Park.","34":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the ferry, then start your holiday in the boot and head to the coast.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"drive aboard the ferry\" which is not mentioned in Summary B.\n* The article sentence also mentions \"start your holiday in relaxing surroundings\" which is not mentioned in Summary B.\n* Summary A is a more accurate representation of the article sentence as it includes all the information mentioned in the sentence.","35":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: herrera also revealed that rooney has to keep the conversation away from boxing.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that herrera revealed that captain wayne rooney is the joker inside united's dressing room, but also admits that he has to keep the conversation away from boxing, for fears rooney might hit him. Summary A accurately captures this information by stating that rooney has to keep the conversation away from boxing. Summary B, on the other hand, only mentions that rooney is the joker inside united's dressing room, which is not entirely accurate as the article also mentions the reason for this (to avoid being hit).","36":" Based on the article sentence \"to this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded,\" the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded.\n\nExplanation: Both summaries include all the information from the original sentence, but Summary A is a more precise representation of the sentence as it includes the phrase \"to this day,\" which is present in the original sentence.","37":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: prince of wales described as 'unique moment in anyone's life'\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the prince of wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as \"a unique moment in anyone's life,\" which is supported by the phrase \"unique moment in anyone's life\" in Summary A. Summary B does not fully capture the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions \"a unique moment\" without the specific phrase \"in anyone's life.\" Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","38":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the club has managed to preserve a pastime that requires vast open space.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not entirely accurate as it states that the club has managed to protect a pastime that is larger than Manhattan, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately conveys the main idea of the article sentence by stating that the club has managed to preserve a pastime that requires vast open space, which is supported by the information provided in the article sentence.","39":" Based on the article sentence \"in stuart lancaster's fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition,\" the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: stuart lancaster's side are yet to win this competition.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence as it states that they will win the competition, which is not supported by the article. The article states that they are yet to win the competition, indicating that they have not won it yet.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, is consistent with the article sentence as it states that Stuart Lancaster's side are yet to win the competition, which is supported by the article.","40":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: moores, a county championship, finds himself under increasing pressure.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article mentions that Moores is a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, but the summary does not include this information.\n* The article mentions that Moores is under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level, but the summary only mentions that he finds himself under increasing pressure.\n\nTherefore, summary A is more consistent with the article as it accurately conveys the information that Moores is under pressure to prove himself at the international level.","41":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the aspergillus genus.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries include the information that he filmed using a specially designed set-up, but only Summary A includes the additional information that the organism he filmed was part of the aspergillus genus. This information is not present in Summary B. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence.","42":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: the easter bunny was invented in german folklore, where an 'easter hare' was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries contain some information from the article sentence, but only Summary A accurately conveys all the information in the article sentence. The article sentence states that the Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, where an 'Easter hare' was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved. Summary A includes all of this information, while Summary B leaves out the detail that the Easter hare was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","43":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: scotland international made an # 11million move from leeds in the summer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the Scotland international made an #11million move from Leeds in the summer, but the move has backfired with Fulham falling perilously close to the relegation places in recent weeks. This information is not supported by Summary A, which states that the Scotland international made an #11million move from Fulham in the summer. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","44":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: moores, a county championship winner with both sussex and lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after england's woeful showing at this world cup.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A only mentions that Moores is under increasing pressure, but it does not provide any context or information about his background or achievements. Summary B, on the other hand, provides more information about Moores' background and achievements, and also mentions the specific reason why he is under pressure (England's woeful showing at the World Cup). This makes Summary B more consistent with the article sentence.","45":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: he filmed using a specially designed set-up part of the aspergillus genus.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is incorrect because it refers to the genus genus, which is not a specific genus. The article mentions that the moulds were part of the aspergillus genus, which is a specific genus of fungi.\n\nSummary B correctly states that the moulds were filmed using a specially designed set-up, and that they were part of the aspergillus genus. This summary is consistent with the information provided in the article.","46":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: mike catt wants england to be more ruthless when it comes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries convey the main idea of the article sentence, but Summary A is more consistent as it includes all the information from the original sentence. Summary B omits the phrase \"when it comes\" which is present in the original sentence. Therefore, Summary A is the more accurate and consistent summary of the article sentence.","47":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: he was also ordered to pay $ 167 million in restitution and fines.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the person was ordered to pay $167 million in restitution and fines, which is consistent with Summary B.

It states \"for first time in a row\" which suggests that the team had a streak of consecutive successful performances, which is not supported by the article.","49":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: lee, 91, is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of singapore general hospital.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article sentence, which states that Lee is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital. Summary B omits the location of the hospital, which is not supported by the article sentence.","50":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: aubrey said she would be eligible when he is five years old.\n\nThe article sentence states that Aubrey was told that her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old, which implies that Aubrey herself will be eligible for the wheelchair at that age, not her son. Therefore, Summary A is a more accurate representation of the information in the article sentence.","51":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: they made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the material was made by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film. The wording \"onto a silicon film\" is not explicitly mentioned in the summary, but it is implied by the phrase \"etching features smaller than a wavelength of light.\" Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","52":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA. sebastian vettel is the german's own successful move from red bull.\n\nThe article mentions that Sebastian Vettel made a successful move from Red Bull to Ferrari, which is supported by the fact that he was on the podium after Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix. This information is not mentioned in summary B. Therefore, summary A is more consistent with the article.","53":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary B: the club has managed to protect a pastime that requires vast open space.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A states that the club has managed to protect a pastime that is larger than Manhattan, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article sentence. While the article does mention that the club has protected a patchwork of land that is larger than Manhattan, it does not specify the size of the pastime.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B accurately captures the essence of the article sentence by stating that the club has managed to protect a pastime that requires vast open space, which is supported by the information in the article.","54":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary B: the russian poet says it's better to die from vodka than from boredom.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the quote is from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, so it is more accurate to attribute the quote to the poet rather than just saying \"the Russian says.\" Additionally, the wording of Summary B is a more direct quote of the phrase from the article sentence.","55":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: coach peter moores talks to media during a press conference.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that the coach, Peter Moores, talks to the media during a press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday. Therefore, Summary B, which mentions that the coach talks to media during a press conference, is more consistent with the article sentence.","56":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: sam livesey, 18, was captured on a clip of oldham's jack tuohy.\n\nThe article sentence states that Sam Livesey, 18, was captured on a clip obtained by Sportsmail appearing to strike Oldham's unsuspecting Jack Tuohy in the temple. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that Sam Livesey was captured on a clip of Oldham's Jack Tuohy.\n\nSummary B does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence as it states that Sam Livesey was captured by Sportsmail appearing to strike Oldham's unsuspecting Jack Tuohy. There is no mention of Sportsmail in the article sentence.","57":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary B: he claims that he was a boy when he was two.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states \"he claims he knew he was a boy when he was two,\" which implies that the person claimed to be a boy at the age of two. Summary B accurately conveys this information by stating \"he claims that he was a boy when he was two.\" Summary A, on the other hand, uses the phrase \"a young boy,\" which could be interpreted as suggesting that the person was not yet a boy at the age of two, but rather a young child. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary with the article.","58":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: lucy powell, 40, became embroiled in a dispute over powell's brit awards plans.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries mention Lucy Powell, but only Summary B includes the specific information that the dispute is over her Brit Awards plans. This information is supported by the article sentence, which states that the dispute was over Ms. Powell's Brit Awards plans. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","59":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to pummel her.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is incomplete as it only includes the first action of the man forcing the girl to the ground, but does not include the second action of pummeling her with a stone.\n\nSummary B includes both actions, and is therefore more consistent with the article sentence.","60":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: clinton said the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.\n\nThe article sentence states that Clinton said \"the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses,\" and Summary A accurately reflects this by using the phrase \"vast majority\" to convey the same level of detail and precision as the original sentence. In contrast, Summary B omits the word \"vast\" and simply states \"the majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses,\" which is less precise and does not fully capture the information in the original sentence.","61":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A only mentions \"passengers face travel chaos this Easter\" without including the expected engineering projects, which is not supported by the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, includes the expected engineering projects, which is supported by the article sentence. Additionally, the phrase \"are expected\" is included in Summary B, which provides more information and makes the summary more consistent with the article.","62":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: aubrey said she was told he was eligible when he is five years old.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Aubrey was told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old. The word \"told\" indicates that someone conveyed this information to Aubrey, and the sentence does not explicitly state that Aubrey said this herself. Therefore, Summary B is a more accurate representation of the information in the article sentence.","63":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: atlanta falcons have been fined # 237,000 for use of fake crowd noise.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries mention the fine and the use of fake crowd noise, but only Summary B specifically states that the fine was for the use of fake crowd noise. This is more consistent with the article sentence, which specifically mentions the Georgia Dome and the use of fake crowd noise.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","64":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nAnswer: B - Pearce has been in charge of England under-21s for six years.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Pearce was in charge of England under-21s for six years, but does not mention anything about him being tipped to replace Roy Hodgson (Summary A). Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary with the article.","65":" Based on the information provided, the more consistent summary with the article sentence is:\n\nSummary A: the world cup winner has been 'ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good'.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that the world cup winner said \"ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good.\"\n* Summary A accurately conveys this information by stating that the world cup winner has been (i.e., has had) ninety-nine per cent of the things that were very good.\n* Summary B is not as consistent with the article sentence, as it only quotes the world cup winner's statement without providing any additional information about the things that were good.","66":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: but now conditions on the farms that supply kfc with 23million chickens a year can be shown.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"but now\" which indicates a change or a new development.

However, Summary B is more concise and directly quotes the phrase \"increasingly perplexed\" from the article sentence, making it a more consistent summary.","68":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed.\n\nBoth summaries contain the same information, but Summary A provides more detail by specifying that the chickens live together in huge sheds. This information is supported by the article sentence, which mentions that the chickens live together in huge sheds. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","69":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: passengers can take their own car and the journey is all part.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries capture the essence of the article sentence, but Summary A is more precise and factual. It accurately conveys that passengers can take their own car and that the journey is part of the experience.\n\nSummary B adds the word \"experience\" at the end, which is not explicitly stated in the article sentence. While it may be implied, it is not as direct and factual as Summary A. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","70":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary B: beleaguered travellers warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that \"beleaguered travellers have been warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned.\"\n* Summary B accurately captures this information by stating that beleaguered travellers have been warned that Easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned.\n* Summary A does not accurately capture the information in the article sentence, as it only mentions that beleaguered trains are concerned and many key services will be axed, without mentioning Easter being cancelled.","71":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the fish was discovered in the gurupi river in north central brazil.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Both summaries mention the location of the fish's discovery, which is correct.\n* However, only Summary B mentions the specific region where the fish was discovered, which is \"north central Brazil.\" This information is supported by the article sentence, which states that the fish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil.\n* Summary A does not include the specific region, only mentioning \"north Brazil,\" which is not as specific or accurate as Summary B.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","72":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: she was asked to 'get an interpreter' by staff at port orange post office.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the deaf woman claims she was told to \"get an interpreter\" by staff at the Port Orange post office in Florida.\n\nSummary A accurately reflects this information by stating that the woman was asked to get an interpreter, which is supported by the article.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, states that the woman was told to get an interpreter, which is not entirely accurate as the article states that she was asked to get an interpreter.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary with the article.","73":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: migrants who come to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years, which implies that they have not committed any crimes.

The sentence is a direct quote, and the wording of the quote is important. Therefore, the summary should accurately reflect the wording of the quote.\n\nSummary A omits the word \"better\" and changes the phrasing of the quote slightly, which is not consistent with the article sentence. Summary B, on the other hand, accurately reflects the wording of the quote and is therefore more consistent with the article.","75":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: ayew has netted six times for marseille this season.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Ayew has netted six times for Marseille this season, and also scored three during the Africa Cup of Nations. Therefore, the summary that focuses only on his performances for Marseille this season is more consistent with the article.","76":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked, but it does not mention the word \"crash.\" Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it only includes information that is supported by the article. Summary B includes additional information that is not present in the article.","77":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: brittney ross brewer, from windham, maine, feared she wouldn't make it till her february 27 nuptials.\n\nThis summary accurately captures the information in the article sentence that Brittney Ross Brewer feared she wouldn't make it until her February 27 nuptials. The other summary, B, does not include this specific information and is therefore less consistent with the article.","78":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to pummel her.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A omits the word \"young\" before \"girl,\" which is present in the article sentence. Additionally, Summary A uses the phrase \"forces the ground,\" which is not present in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately includes the word \"young\" before \"girl\" and uses the phrase \"forces the ground,\" which is consistent with the article sentence.","79":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: google dubbed the first set of several thousand glass users.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence only mentions \"glass users,\" without mentioning \"glass glass users.\" Therefore, the summary should only include \"glass users\" to be consistent with the article.","80":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary B: professor jonathan armbruster said his colleagues noticed resemblance to the alien killed by han solo.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article, which states that Professor Jonathan Armbruster's colleagues noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films. The other summary, A, does not accurately convey this information and is therefore less consistent with the article.","81":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: chelsea's izzy brown has been named in sean o'driscoll's european qualifiers.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"chelsea's izzy brown (left)\" being named in Sean O'Driscoll's side for the European qualifiers.\n* Summary B accurately reflects this information by specifying that it is Chelsea's Izzy Brown who has been named in the European qualifiers, rather than just \"Chelsea\" as in Summary A.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","82":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: passengers can look at fish while staying dry and is small.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that the diminutive sub can dive to depths of up to 300ft (91 meters) so passengers can look at fish while staying dry.\n* Summary B accurately conveys this information by stating that passengers can look at fish while staying dry and is small.\n* Summary A does not accurately convey this information as it only states that passengers can look at fish while staying on a yacht, without mentioning the depth or the fact that the sub is small.","83":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary with the article sentence would be:\n\nSummary A: the ex-chief of defence staff said he was'mystified' about the police.\n\nThe article sentence states that the ex-chief of defence staff was \"mystified\" about why the police had searched his home in Surrey, but the summary B only mentions that he was \"mystified\" about the police, without specifying why. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article sentence as it accurately reflects the content of the sentence.","84":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: kane is one of the most talked about players in the rovers.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"Roy of the Rovers rise continues apace,\" which implies that Kane's success is specific to the Rovers team, rather than the entire country. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it focuses on Kane's popularity within the Rovers team.","85":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the american hunt is a chase - the intent is not to kill.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A mentions a ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns, which is not mentioned in the article sentence.

This implies that marcos lopes is the correct name of the player, and \"Ligue 1 club\" is a more specific and accurate term than \"Manchester City\" to describe the club he is currently playing for. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","93":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: David Cameron leads a double life as a seedy drug addict.\n\nThe article mentions that the person has spoken of personally meeting Prime Minister David Cameron, but it also describes them as leading a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes.

This could be considered an incomplete or inaccurate summary of the article sentence.","100":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: stuart pearce believes gary neville needs to get managerial experience.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to get managerial experience of his own before he can be considered as a possible successor to Roy Hodgson as England head coach. This implies that Neville needs to gain more than just a single managerial job, but rather a range of experiences in management before being considered for the role. Therefore, Summary B accurately captures the essence of the article sentence by using the phrase \"managerial experience\" instead of \"managerial job.\"","101":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: giorgio armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating vogue.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"Vogue\" and the creation of the \"skouser\" (a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material), which is not present in Summary B.

In contrast, Summary A only mentions the Rose, which is not fully consistent with the article sentence.","109":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: nelly is the first american artist to perform in the city's 8,000 year old history.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the concert was put on by the Rwanga Foundation, a non-profit created to help those in the area, and the group claims that Nelly is the first American artist to perform in the city's 8,000 year old history.

Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article.","112":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary with the article sentence is:\n\nSummary B: australia all-rounder james faulkner won't be surprised if there's verbal exchanges.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that James Faulkner won't be surprised if there's some niggle and verbal exchanges, but it does not mention India's poor form.

Therefore, the correct summary is that the fire's spread had been halted around midnight, which is consistent with the information in the article.\n\nSummary A is not consistent with the article sentence, as it states that the tower itself did not have been halted around midnight, which is not supported by the information in the article.","118":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: fulham striker mccormack gets his shot away as fulham take on watford.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence only mentions that Fulham take on Watford in the championship, but it does not mention any information about Fulham winning or losing the match.

Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article sentence.","191":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nAnswer: A - he scored a 180 charity darts event and was deemed to be blind.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the blind man scored a 180 in a charity darts event and was deemed to be too good to be blind, which suggests that his exceptional performance was the basis for the investigation of benefit fraud. Therefore, the summary that includes both the score and the fact that he is blind (Summary A) is more consistent with the article sentence.","192":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: she always radiates with a natural beauty and relies on some beauty secrets.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that she always radiates with a natural beauty, which is supported by the phrase \"she always radiates with a natural beauty\" in Summary B.\n* The article sentence also mentions that she relies on some beauty secrets, which is supported by the phrase \"and relies on some beauty secrets\" in Summary B.\n\nIn contrast, Summary A does not accurately convey the information in the article sentence, as it states that she has avoided going under the knife or being jabbed with needles, which is not mentioned in the article sentence.","193":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary B: Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime.\n\nThe article mentions that President Barack Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the Middle East, which is a factual statement supported by the article. Summary A does not accurately convey this information and is therefore less consistent with the article.","194":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nA: second draft law would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children.\n\nThe article sentence states that the second draft law would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children, and Summary A accurately reflects this information. Summary B does not provide any information about the law closing jobs to women who choose not to have children, and only states that the law is to go before parliament next month. Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","195":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: hillary clinton's lawyerly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server might extinguish the matter.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct official state department business was improper, and that her lawyerly news conference did not extinguish the matter politically.\n* Summary B accurately captures this information by stating that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server might extinguish the matter, but the news conference did not fully address the issue.\n* Summary A, on the other hand, focuses solely on the idea that the news conference might extinguish the matter for most Americans, which is not entirely accurate based on the article sentence.","196":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: bale has received a lot of criticism but silenced his doubters.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu. Summary B accurately captures this information by stating that bale has received a lot of criticism but silenced his doubters.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, states that bale has been silenced by a La Liga double at the Bernabeu, which is not entirely accurate as the article does not mention anything about bale being silenced. Instead, it highlights that he silenced his doubters with his performance.","197":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: doctors told his parents: 'it's a.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that \"when Avery Wallace was born, doctors told his parents 'it's a girl'\", but the summary should only include the information that is supported by the article. The word \"his\" in the article sentence indicates that the doctors told the parents, not just the mother. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent as it only includes the information that is supported by the article.","198":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the 28-bedroom property is nicknamed the mountain lodge, with multiple cabins overlooking 'trout-soaked ponds'\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article mentions \"multiple cabins\" and \"trout-soaked ponds,\" which are both included in Summary A.\n* The article does not mention \"elk\" or any other information that is included in Summary B.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is more consistent with the information provided in the article sentence.","199":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary B: she was secretly raped in a&e by a male nurse who filmed the attack.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the patient was raped by a male nurse and that the attack was filmed. Summary B accurately captures this information, while Summary A only mentions that the patient tried to kill herself after the police revealed her ordeal, which is not explicitly stated in the article sentence.","200":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: a user of a guide, he knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions \"a user of a guide dog himself,\" which suggests that the speaker has personal experience using a guide dog.\n* Summary A accurately captures this detail by using the phrase \"a user of a guide.\"\n* Summary B omits this detail and simply states \"a user of a guide dog,\" which is less consistent with the article sentence.","201":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nA: critics say they do not go far enough to shut hundreds of branches.\n\nThe article sentence states that critics say the new rules do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country, even when there is no other bank in the community. This information is supported by the phrase \"do not go far enough\" and \"will allow lenders to shut.\" Therefore, summary A is a more consistent summary of the article sentence.","202":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the correct answer is (B) cristiano ronaldo included cristiano ronaldo and iker casillas.\n\nThe article sentence states that \"most players have been criticised - cristiano ronaldo included - but perhaps most under-fire is iker casillas.\" This implies that Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas have been criticised, but the focus is on Iker Casillas being under-fire.\n\nSummary B accurately reflects this by including both Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas, indicating that they have both been criticised.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, only includes Iker Casillas and Cristiano Ronaldo, which is not entirely accurate as the article does not specifically focus on Iker Casillas being under-fire.","203":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary B: $ 45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, sound systems and other home theatre devices.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A includes only a portion of the information provided in the article sentence, specifically mentioning only smart phones, sound systems, and other home theatre devices. However, the article sentence also mentions flat screen televisions, which are not included in Summary A.\n\nOn the other hand, Summary B includes all the information mentioned in the article sentence, including the fact that $ 45 million was used for entertainment items, and lists the specific items that were purchased, such as flat screen televisions, sound systems, and other home theatre devices. Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary with the article.","204":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: the ex-chief of defence staff said he was'mystified' about the police.\n\nThis is because the article sentence only mentions the police searching the ex-chief of defence staff's home in Surrey, without providing any information about why the police did so. Therefore, the summary should focus on the ex-chief of defence staff's confusion about the police, rather than specifying why the police searched his home.","205":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: jenson button was happy to see mclaren be competitive at the malaysian grand prix.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix, not that he was happy to be more competitive himself. Therefore, Summary B, which correctly states that Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be competitive, is more consistent with the article.","206":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: prince of wales described becoming a first-time 'unique moment in anyone's life'\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"becoming a first-time grandfather\" and \"a unique moment in anyone's life.\" Summary A captures both of these aspects by using the phrase \"unique moment in anyone's life.\" Summary B only mentions \"a unique moment,\" which does not fully capture the fact that the prince is experiencing this moment for the first time as a grandfather.","207":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the most consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the lion died while it was being transported.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the lion died while it was being transported, but it does not mention anything about the lion being transported to a hospital. Therefore, Summary B is the most consistent summary as it only includes the information provided in the article sentence.","208":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: ms bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in smethwick, west midlands.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A is incomplete and does not accurately convey the information in the article sentence. The article sentence states that Ms. Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood, which is not reflected in Summary A.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, accurately states that Ms. Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood, which is supported by the information in the article sentence.","209":" Based on the information provided in the article, the most accurate summary is:\n\nSummary B: the current generation of young people is confused about sex ever because of pornography.\n\nThe article states that the current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever, and this confusion is attributed to pornography. Therefore, Summary B accurately conveys the information in the article.","210":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: she and her husband were trying to walk away.\n\nThe article sentence does not mention the gender of the person's spouse, so it is not accurate to assume that the spouse is a woman and use the term \"wife\" in the summary. Using the term \"husband\" in the summary is more consistent with the information provided in the article sentence.","211":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: Pearce has been in charge of England under-21s for six years.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that Pearce was the manager of England under-21s for six years, which is consistent with Summary B. Summary A does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence.","212":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary B: one clip uses audio data collected by the huygens probe.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSummary A mentions \"one video\" while the article sentence mentions \"one clip\". Additionally, Summary A mentions \"audio data\" while the article sentence mentions \"audio data collected by the huygens probe\". Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article as it accurately reflects the information provided in the article sentence.","213":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: five clubs are locked in a scramble for two champions league places.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries capture the main idea of the article sentence, which is that five clubs are competing for two Champions League places. However, Summary B is more precise and factual as it uses the word \"scramble\" to convey the intensity of the competition, which is supported by the article sentence. In contrast, Summary A uses the word \"bid\" which may not accurately convey the level of intensity and competition described in the article.","214":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary B: france's ruling socialists suffered crushing defeat in regional elections last night.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that \"France's ruling socialists suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night.\" This implies that the defeat was not limited to one department, but rather a nationwide defeat for the ruling socialist party. Therefore, Summary B, which states \"France's ruling socialists suffered crushing defeat in regional elections last night,\" is more consistent with the article.\n\nIn contrast, Summary A, which states \"France's ruling department has been branded a'massive failure',\" is not supported by the article sentence. The article does not mention any specific department being branded a failure, only that the ruling socialists suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections.","215":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: he was ordered to pay $ 167 million in restitution and fines.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states \"he was also ordered to pay $ 167 million in restitution and fines,\" which means that the correct term is \"restitution\" instead of \"damages.\" Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","216":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the correct answer is:\n\nA. paul mccartney, bob dylan, clint eastwood, and the queen.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence mentions \"paul mccartney, mick jagger, bob dylan, clint eastwood, and hm the queen\" as people who can say that. Therefore, the summary should include all of these individuals.\n\nSummary A is incorrect because it only includes three of the five individuals mentioned in the article sentence.\n\nSummary B is incorrect because it includes \"clint eastwood\" twice, which is not supported by the article sentence.","217":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the arsenal have been on the 21-year-old's case since last season.\n\nThe article mentions that the gunners have been on the 21-year-old's case since last season, and does not mention anything about the previous year. Therefore, Summary A is the most accurate and consistent summary of the article sentence.","218":" Based on the information provided in the article, the more consistent summary with the article sentence is:\n\nSummary A: katie launched an attack on danny mas, saying: 'no woman should ever propose to a man'\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence states that Katie launched an attack on Danny's partner Joanne Mas, but the summary A accurately reflects this by saying Katie launched an attack on Danny Mas.\n* Both summaries correctly state that Katie said \"no woman should ever propose to a man,\" which is supported by the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary with the article sentence.","219":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: phelps' punishment was due to run out for the world championships in kazan.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Phelps' punishment resulted in him being excluded from the US team for the world championships in Kazan, but it does not mention that his punishment was excluded from the team.

Therefore, the correct summary should also be in the past tense to reflect this fact. Summary B, \"i'm is in a basement in central London,\" is not consistent with the article sentence as it is written in the present tense and does not reflect the past tense of the article sentence.","222":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary B: the europa league must swallow an estimated # 30million in lost revenue.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries mention the estimated # 30million in lost revenue, but only Summary B includes the phrase \"the europa league\" which is present in the article sentence. Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article.","223":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nAnswer: A - giorgio armani gave the'skouser' of slim-fitting trousers.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions that Giorgio Armani created the'skouser', which is a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material. Therefore, the correct summary should highlight this specific creation of Armani's, which is the'skouser'. Summary B does not accurately convey this information and is therefore less consistent with the article.","224":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: eva merkacheva and andrey babushkin were tortured and the well-being of his family and friends were threatened.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article sentence, as it states that the person told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin that they had been tortured and that the well-being of their family and friends were threatened.","225":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: the man, named as saleh, said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that the man named as saleh said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos was a senior figure in the extremist organization responsible for murdering foreign captives.\n* Summary B accurately reflects this information by stating that the man named as saleh said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos.\n* Summary A does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence as it only mentions the man appearing in several beheading videos, without mentioning the context of the extremist organization or the fact that he was a senior figure.","226":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: mr salamone slept on the sofa when they went upstairs to find her dead.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that Mr. Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home, and later went upstairs to find her dead. Summary A accurately reflects this information by stating that Mr. Salamone slept on the sofa when they went upstairs to find her dead. Summary B, on the other hand, does not accurately reflect the information in the article sentence as it does not mention the detail that Mr. Salamone went upstairs to find her dead.","227":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: sportscaster fred katz's crazy eyes warren on orange is the new black\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that Fred Katz challenged Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba (who plays Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on Orange is the New Black) to share a Lady and the Tramp licorice.\n* Summary A accurately captures this information by mentioning \"Fred Katz's Crazy Eyes Warren on Orange is the New Black.\"\n* Summary B does not accurately capture this information as it only mentions \"Crazy Eyes Warren on Orange is the Black\" without specifying that it is Fred Katz's challenge.","228":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: jury told the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the jury heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages, which is consistent with Summary A. Summary B does not fully convey the information in the article sentence, as it only states that the jury heard the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages, without specifying that the jury heard how the duo had planned to do so.","229":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: matthew crawley asked lady mary to marry him in the first downton abbey.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"the first downton abbey christmas special, broadcast in 2011,\" which implies that the event took place during the first Christmas special of the show. Therefore, Summary A, which simply states that Matthew asked Mary to marry him in the first Downton Abbey, is the most consistent with the article. Summary B, which mentions \"the first downton abbey christmas,\" is not as accurate because it implies that the proposal took place only during the Christmas special, while the article sentence indicates that it took place during the first Christmas special broadcast in 2011.","230":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: charles is said to have become increasingly increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role.\n\nThe article sentence states that Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young prince's life, and the word \"increasingly\" is used twice to emphasize the gradual nature of Charles' perplexity. Summary A accurately captures this nuance by using the word \"increasingly\" twice to describe Charles' perplexity. In contrast, Summary B omits the second instance of \"increasingly,\" which makes the statement less accurate.","231":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: police have launched an investigation into the 'unexplained death' of sophia walker.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence uses the phrase \"unexplained death,\" which implies that the circumstances surrounding Sophia Walker's death are not yet clear.\n* Summary B uses the same phrase, \"unexplained death,\" which is consistent with the article.\n* Summary A uses the phrase \"tragic death,\" which is not directly supported by the article sentence.\n\nTherefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary of the article sentence.","232":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: passengers can take their own car and journey is all part of the experience.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth summaries capture the essence of the article sentence, but Summary B is more precise and factual as it includes the phrase \"all part of the experience,\" which is directly quoted from the article sentence.

Therefore, Summary B is the more consistent summary.","233":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article is:\n\nSummary A: one video uses audio data collected by the huygens probe.\n\nThe article sentence mentions that the audio data was collected by the huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan, but it does not mention the descent itself. Therefore, Summary A is a more accurate summary of the article sentence, as it focuses only on the audio data collected by the probe.","234":" Based on the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: hillary clinton's lawyerly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server might extinguish the matter.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The article sentence mentions that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct official state department business was improper, but the summary should focus on the implications of this fact, rather than the fact itself.\n* Summary B accurately conveys the essence of the article sentence by highlighting Clinton's efforts to parry suggestions that her use of a private email server was improper, which is a key aspect of the article's focus on the political implications of the matter.\n* In contrast, Summary A oversimplifies the article sentence by suggesting that Clinton's use of a private email server might extinguish the matter for most Americans, which is not directly supported by the article sentence.","235":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary B: ms bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in smethwick.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Both summaries mention that Ms. Bensley was found dead in a pool of something (blood or her own head).\n* However, only Summary B mentions the specific location of Smethwick, West Midlands, which is mentioned in the article sentence.\n* Therefore, Summary B is more consistent with the article information.","236":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nB: they have been transferred to nusakambangan island where they are expected to be executed.\n\nThe article states that the individuals have been on death row since 2005 and have now been transferred to Nusakambangan island, which suggests that they are expected to be executed. Summary B accurately reflects this information, while Summary A does not.","237":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary A: beleaguered trains are concerned and many key services will be axed.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article sentence, which states that trains are concerned and many key services will be axed during Easter.

This is because the article states that Irfan has taken eight wickets in five matches, which is consistent with the information in Summary B.","240":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the correct answer is (B) obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime. The sentence states that President Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the Middle East, but does not mention a nuclear deal between the US and Iran.

Since the article does not mention Anderlecht maintaining a watching brief on themselves, Summary A is the more consistent option.","242":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary A: the 27 year-old serb's victory not only put him into the final of 10.\n\nThis is because the article mentions that the Serb's victory was his ninth out of 10 against Murray, indicating that there have been 10 previous matches between the two players. Summary A accurately reflects this information by mentioning \"the final of 10.\"","243":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary is:\n\nSummary B: the model had to have a combination of pmma and hydrogel removed.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence states that the model had to have a combination of PMMA and hydrogel removed from her body, which implies that the removal of these substances was necessary.

Therefore, Summary B, which accurately reflects this, is the more consistent summary.","246":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: mike catt wants england to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points.\n\nExplanation: The article sentence mentions \"scoring points\" specifically, which is not included in Summary B. Therefore, Summary A is more consistent with the article as it includes the specific information mentioned in the article.","247":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary with the article would be:\n\nSummary A: khalsa secondary academy does not want her 11-year-old daughter freya to go.\n\nThis summary accurately reflects the information in the article that Kirsty Jarvis does not want her daughter Freya to attend the Khalsa secondary academy because she would be a minority. The wording of the summary is also consistent with the language used in the article.\n\nSummary B: kirsty jarvis does not want her 11-year-old daughter freya to go as a'minority' is not as accurate as it includes additional information that is not present in the article.","248":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the more consistent summary would be:\n\nSummary B: the championship promotion hopefuls had made enquiries about signing jordan rhodes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe article sentence states that the championship promotion hopefuls had made enquiries about signing Jordan Rhodes from Blackburn Rovers, but the Ewood Park club's reluctance to deal has prompted fresh questions about McCormack.

This implies that the individual identified as a boy from a young age, which is consistent with Summary B.\n\nSummary A, on the other hand, states that the transgender 15-year-old knew he was a child from the age of two. While this summary is partially consistent with the article sentence, it does not accurately convey the information provided. The article does not mention the individual identifying as a child, but rather as a boy.

Therefore, Summary A is the more consistent summary.","317":" Based on the information provided in the article sentence, the correct answer is (A) Scotland beat Scotland in the first round of the match. The article mentions that France made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday, and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm.
